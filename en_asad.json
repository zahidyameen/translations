And if God so willed, He could indeed take away their hearing and their sight: for, verily, God has the power to will anything.","28":"O MANKIND! Worship your Sustainer, who has created you and those who lived before you, so that you might remain conscious of Him","29":"who has made the earth a resting-place for you and the sky a canopy, and has sent down water from the sky and thereby brought forth fruits for your sustenance: do not, then, claim that there is any power that could rival God, when you know [that He is One].","30":"And if you doubt any part of what We have, bestowed from on high, step by step, upon Our servant [Muhammad], then produce a surah of similar merit, and call upon any other than God to bear witness for you -if what you say is true!","31":"And if you cannot do it-and most certainly you cannot do it-then be conscious of the fire whose fuel is human beings and stones which awaits all who deny the truth!","32":"But unto those who have attained to faith and do good works give the glad tiding that theirs shall be gardens through which running waters flow. Whenever they are granted fruits there from as their appointed sustenance, they will say, \"It is this that in days of yore was granted to us as our sustenance!\"-for they shall be given something that will recall that [past]. And there shall they have spouses pure, and there shall they abide.","33":"Behold, God does not disdain to propound a parable of a gnat, or of something [even] less than that. Now, as for those who have attained to faith, they know that it is the truth from their Sustainer - whereas those who are bent on denying the truth say, \"What could God mean by this parable?\" In this way does He cause many a one to go astray, just as He guides many a one aright: but none does He cause thereby to go astray save the iniquitous,","34":"who break their bond with God after it has been established [in their nature], and cut asunder what God has bidden to be joined, and spread corruption on earth: these it is that shall be the losers.","35":"How can you refuse to acknowledge God, seeing that you were lifeless and He gave you life, and that He will cause you to die and then will bring you again to life, whereupon unto Him you will be brought back?","36":"He it is who has created for you all that is on earth, and has applied His design to the heavens and fashioned them into seven heavens; and He alone has full knowledge of everything.","37":"AND LO! Thy Sustainer said unto the angels: \"Behold, I am about to establish upon earth one who shall inherit it.\" They said: \"Wilt Thou place on it such as will spread corruption thereon and shed blood -whereas it is we who extol Thy limitless glory, and praise Thee, and hallow Thy name?\" [God] answered: \"Verily, I know that which you do not know.\"","38":"And He imparted unto Adam the names of all things; then He brought them within the ken of the angels and said: \"Declare unto Me the names of these [things], if what you say is true.\"","39":"They replied: \"Limitless art Thou in Thy glory! No knowledge have we save that which Thou hast imparted unto us. Verily, Thou alone art all-knowing, truly wise.\"","40":"Said He: \"O Adam, convey unto them the names of these [things].\" And as soon as [Adam] had conveyed unto them their names, [God] said: \"Did I not say unto you, `Verily, I alone know the hidden reality of the heavens and the earth, and know all that you bring into the open and all. that you would conceal'?\"","41":"And when We told the angels, \"Prostrate yourselves before Adam!\" -they all prostrated themselves, save Iblis, who refused and gloried in his arrogance: and thus he became one of those who deny the truth.","42":"And We said: \"O Adam, dwell thou and thy wife in this garden, and eat freely thereof, both of you, whatever you may wish; but do not approach this one tree, lest you become wrongdoers.\"","43":"But Satan caused them both to stumble therein, and thus brought about the loss of their erstwhile state. And so We said: \"Down with you, [and be henceforth] enemies unto one another; and on earth you shall have your abode and your livelihood for a while!\"","44":"Thereupon Adam received words [of guidance] from his Sustainer, and He accepted his repentance: for, verily, He alone is the-Acceptor of Repentance, the Dispenser of Grace.","45":"[For although] We did say, \"Down with you all from this [state],\" there shall, none the less, most certainly come unto you guidance from Me: and those who follow My guidance need have no fear, and neither shall they grieve;","46":"but those who are bent on denying the truth and giving the lie to Our messages - they are destined for the fire, and therein shall they abide.","47":"O CHILDREN of Israel! Remember those blessings of Mine with which I graced you, and fulfil your promise unto Me, [whereupon] I shall fulfil My promise unto you; and of Me, of Me stand in awe!","48":"Believe in that which I have [now] bestowed from on high, confirming the truth already in your possession, and be not foremost among those who deny its truth; and do not barter away My messages for a trifling gain; and of Me, of Me be conscious","49":"And do not overlay the truth with falsehood, and do not knowingly suppress the truth;","50":"and be constant in prayer, and spend in charity, and bow down in prayer with all who thus bow down.","51":"Do you bid other people to be pious, the while you forget your own selves -and yet you recite the divine writ? Will you not, then, use your reason?;","52":"And seek aid in steadfast patience and prayer: and this, indeed, is a hard thing for all but the humble in spirit,","53":"who know with certainty that they shall meet their Sustainer and that unto Him they shall return.","54":"O children of Israel! Remember those blessings of Mine with which I graced you, and how I favoured you above all other people;","55":"and remain conscious of [the coming of] a Day when no human being shall in the least avail another, nor shall intercession be accepted from any of them, nor ransom taken from them, and none shall be succoured.","56":"And [remember the time] when We saved you from Pharaoh's people, who afflicted you with cruel suffering, slaughtering your sons and sparing [only] your women - which was an awesome trial from your Sustainer;","57":"and when We cleft the sea before you, and thus saved you and caused Pharaoh's people to drown before your very eyes;","58":"and when We appointed for Moses forty nights [on Mount Sinai], and in his absence you took to worshipping the [golden] calf, and thus became evildoers:","59":"yet, even after that, We blotted out this your sin, so that you might have cause to be grateful.","60":"And [remember the time] when We vouchsafed unto Moses the divine writ-and [thus] a standard by which to discern the true from the false -so that you might be guided aright;","61":"and when Moses said unto his people: \"O my people! Verily, you have sinned against yourselves by worshipping the calf; turn, then. in repentance to your Maker and mortify yourselves; this will be the best for you in your Maker's sight\". And thereupon He accepted your repentance: for, behold, He alone is the Acceptor of Repentance, the Dispenser of Grace.","62":"And [remember] when you said, \"O Moses. indeed we shall not believe thee unto we see God face to face!\" - whereupon the thunderbolt of punishment overtook you before your very eyes.","63":"But We raised you again after you had been as dead, so that you might have cause to be grateful.","64":"And We caused the clouds to comfort you with their shade, and sent down unto you manna and quails. [saying,] \"Partake of the good things which We have provided for you as sustenance.\" And [by all their sinning] they did no harm unto Us-but [only] against their own selves did they sin.","65":"And [remember the time] when We said: \"Enter this land, and eat of its food as you may desire. abundantly; but enter the gate humbly and say, `Remove Thou from us the burden of our sins', [whereupon] We shall forgive you your sins, and shall amply reward the doers of good.\"","66":"But those who were bent on evildoing substituted another saying for that which had been given them: and so We sent down upon those evildoers a plague from heaven in requital for all their iniquity.","67":"And [remember] when Moses prayed for water for his people and We replied, \"Strike the rock with thy staff!\"-whereupon twelve springs gushed forth from it, so that all the people knew whence to drink. [And Moses said:] \"Eat and drink the sustenance provided by God, and do not act wickedly on earth by spreading corruption.\"","68":"And [remember] when you said: \"O Moses, indeed we cannot endure but one kind of food; pray, then, to thy Sustainer that He bring forth for us aught of what grows from the earth - of its herbs, its cucumbers, its garlic, its lentils, its onions.\" Said [Moses]: \"Would you take a lesser thing in exchange for what is [so much] better? Go back in shame to Egypt, and then you can have what you are asking for!\" And so, ignominy and humiliation overshadowed them, and they earned the burden of God's condemnation: all this, because they persisted in denying the truth of God's messages and in slaying the prophets against all right: all this, because they rebelled [against God], and persisted in transgressing the bounds of what is right.","69":"VERILY, those who have attained to faith [in this divine writ], as well as those who follow the Jewish faith, and the Christians, and the Sabians -all who believe in God and the Last Day and do righteous deeds-shall have their reward with their Sustainer; and no fear need they have, and neither shall they grieve.","70":"AND LO! We accepted your solemn pledge, raising Mount Sinai high above you, [and saying;] \"Hold fast with [all your] strength unto what We have vouchsafed you, and bear in mind all that is therein, so that you might remain conscious of God!\"","71":"And you turned away after that-! And had it not been for God's favour upon you and His grace, you would surely have found yourselves among the lost;","72":"for you are well aware of those from among you who profaned the Sabbath, whereupon We said unto them, \"Be as apes despicable!\"","73":"and set them up as a warning example for their time and for all times to come, as well as an admonition to all who are conscious of God.","74":"AND LO! Moses said unto his people: \"Behold, God bids you to sacrifice a cow.\" They said: \"Dost thou mock at us?\" He answered: \"I seek refuge with God against being so ignorant!\"","75":"Said they: \"Pray on our behalf unto thy Sustainer that He make clear to us what she is to be like.\" [Moses] replied: \"Behold, He says it is to be a cow neither old nor immature, but of art age in-between. Do, then, what you have been bidden!\"","76":"Said they: \"Pray on our behalf unto thy Sustainer that He make clear to us what her colour should be. \"[Mopes] answered: \"Behold; He says it is to be a yellow cow, bright of hue, pleasing to the beholder.\"","77":"Said' they: \"Pray on our behalf unto thy Sustainer that He make clear to us what she is to be like, for to us all cows resemble one another; and then, if God so wills, we shall truly be guided aright!\"","78":"[Moses] answered: \"Behold, He says it is to be a cow not broken-in to plough the earth or to water the crops, free of fault, without markings of any other colour.\"Said they: \"At last thou hast brought out the truth!\"-and thereupon they sacrificed her, although they had almost left it undone.","79":"For, O children of Israel, because you had slain a human being and then cast the blame for this [crime] upon one another -although God will bring to light what you would conceals","80":"We said: \"Apply this [principle] to some of those [cases of unresolved murder]: in this way God saves lives from death and shows you His will, so that you might [learn to] use your reason.\"","81":"And yet, after all this, your hearts hardened and became like rocks, or even harder: for, behold, there are rocks from which streams gush forth; and, behold, there are some from which, when they are cleft, water issues; and, behold, there are some that fall down for awe of God And God is not unmindful of what you do!","82":"CAN YOU, then, hope that they will believe in what you are preaching - seeing that a good many of them were wont to listen to the word of God and then, after having understood it, to pervert it knowingly?","83":"For, when they meet those who have attained to faith. they say, \"We believe [as you believe]\" - but when they find themselves alone with one another, they say. \"Do you inform them of what God has disclosed to you, so that they might use it in argument against you, quoting the words of your Sustainer? Will you not. then, use your reason?\"","84":"Do they not know, then, that God is aware of all that they would conceal as well as of all that they bring into the open?","85":"And there are among them unlettered people who have no real knowledge of the divine writ, [following] only wishful beliefs and depending on nothing but conjecture.","86":"Woe, then, unto those who write down, with their own hands, [something which they claim to be] divine writ, and then say. \"This is from God,\" in order to acquire a trifling gain thereby; woe, then, unto them for what their hands have written, and woe unto them for all that they may have gained!","87":"And they say, \"The fire will most certainly not touch us for more than a limited number of days.\" Say [unto them]: \"Have you received a promise from God - for God never breaks His promise - or do you attribute to God something which you cannot know?\"","88":"Yea! Those who earn evil and by their sinfulness are engulfed - they are destined for the fire. therein to abide;","89":"whereas those who attain to faith and do righteous deeds -they are destined for paradise, therein to abide.","90":"AND LO! We accepted this solemn pledge from [you,] ' the children of Israel: \"You shall worship none but God; and you shall do good unto your parents and kinsfolk, and the orphans, and the poor; and you shall speak unto all people in a kindly way; and you shall be constant in prayer; and you shall spend in charity.” And yet, save for a few of you, you turned away: for you are obstinate folk!","91":"And lo! We accepted your solemn pledge that you would not shed one another's blood, and would not drive one another from your homelands - whereupon you acknowledged it; and thereto you bear witness [even now].","92":"And yet, it is you who slay one another and drive some of your own people from their homelands, aiding one another against them in sin and hatred; but if they come to you as captives, you ransom them - although the very [act of] driving them away has been made unlawful to you!. Do you, then, believe in some parts of the divine writ and deny the truth of other parts? What, then, could be the reward of those among you who do such things but ignominy in the life of this world and, on the Day of Resurrection, commitment to most grievous suffering? For God is not unmindful of what you do.","93":"All who buy the life of this world at the price of the life to come - their suffering shall not be lightened, nor shall they be succoured!","94":"For, indeed, We vouchsafed unto Moses the divine writ and caused apostle after apostle to follow him; and We vouchsafed unto Jesus, the son of Mary, all evidence of the truth, and strengthened him with holy inspiration. [Yet] is it not so that every time an apostle came unto you with something that was not to your liking, you gloried in your arrogance, and to some of them you gave the lie, while others you would slay?","95":"But they say, \"Our hearts are already full of knowledge.\" Nay, but God has rejected them because of their refusal to acknowledge the truth: for, few are the things in which they believe.","96":"And whenever there came unto them a [new] revelation from God, confirming the truth already in their possession-and [bear in mind that] aforetime they used to pray for victory over those who were bent on denying the truth -: whenever there came unto them something which they recognized [as the truth], they would deny it. And God's rejection is the due of all who deny the truth.","97":"Vile is that [false pride] for which they have sold their own selves by denying the truth of what God has bestowed from on high, out of envy that God should bestow aught of His favour upon whomsoever He wills of His servants: and thus have they earned the burden of God's condemnation, over and over. And for those who deny the truth there is shameful suffering in store.","98":"For when they are told, \"Believe in what God has bestowed from on high,\" they reply, \"We believe [only] in what has been bestowed on us\"-and they deny the truth of everything else, although it be a truth confirming the one already in their possession. Say \"Why, then, did you slay God's prophets aforetime, if you were (truly] believers?\"","99":"And indeed, there came unto you Moses with all evidence of the truth - and thereupon. in his absence, you took to worshipping the (golden] calf, and acted wickedly.","100":"And, lo, We accepted your solemn pledge, raising Mount Sinai high above you, [saying,] \"Hold fast with [all your] strength unto what We have vouchsafed you, and hearken unto it!\" [But] they say, \"We have heard, but we disobey\" - for their hearts are filled to overflowing with love of the [golden] calf because of their refusal to acknowledge the truth. Say: \"Vile is what this [false] belief of yours enjoins upon you-if indeed you are believers!\"","101":"Say: \"If an afterlife with God is to be for you alone, to the exclusion of all other people, then. you should long for death-if what you say is true!\"","102":"But never will they long for it, because [they are aware] of what their hands have sent ahead in this world: and God has full knowledge of evildoers.","103":"And thou wilt most certainly find that they cling to life more eagerly than any other people, even more than those who are bent on ascribing divinity to other beings beside God: every one of them would love to live a thousand years, although the grant of long life could not save him from suffering [in the hereafter]: for God sees all that they do.","104":"SAY [O Prophet]: \"Whosoever is an enemy of Gabriel\" -who,, verily, by God's leave, has brought down upon thy heart this [divine writ] which confirms the truth of whatever there still remains [of earlier revelations], and is a guidance and a glad tiding for the believers-:","105":"\"whosover is an enemy of God and His angels and His message-bearers, including Gabriel and Michael, [should know that,] verily, God is the enemy of all who deny the truth.\"","106":"For, clear messages indeed have We bestowed upon thee from on high; and none denies their truth save the iniquitous.","107":"Is it not so that every time they made a promise [unto God], some of them cast it aside? Nay, indeed: most of them do not believe.","108":"And [even now,] when there has come unto them an apostle from God, confirming the truth already in their possession, some of those who were granted revelation aforetime cast the divine writ behind their backs as though unaware [of what it says],","109":"and follow [instead] that which the evil ones used to practice during Solomon's reign - for it was not Solomon who denied the truth, but those evil ones denied it by teaching people sorcery -; and [they follow] that which has come down through the two angels in Babylon, Hurut and Marut-although these two never taught it to anyone without first declaring, \"We are but a temptation to evil: do not, then, deny [God's] truth!\" And they learn from these two how to create discord between a man and his wife; but whereas they can harm none thereby save by God's leave, they acquire a knowledge that only harms themselves and does not benefit them - although they know; indeed, that he who acquires this [knowledge] shall have no share in the good of the life to come. For, vile indeed is that [art] for which they have sold their own selves -had they but known it!","110":"And had they but believed and been conscious of Him, reward from God would indeed have brought them good-had they but known it!","111":"O YOU who have attained to faith! Do not say [to the Prophet], \"Listen to us,\" but rather say, \"Have patience with us,\" and hearken [unto him], since grievous suffering awaits those who deny the truth.","112":"Neither those from among the followers of earlier revelation who are bent on denying the truth, nor those who ascribe divinity to other beings beside God, would like to see any good ever bestowed upon you from on high by your Sustainer; but God singles out for His grace whom He wills-for God is limitless in His great bounty.","113":"Any message which, We annul or consign to oblivion We replace with a better or a similar one. Dost thou not know that God has the power to will anything?","114":"Dost thou not know that God's is the dominion over the heavens and the earth, and that besides God you have none to protect you or bring you succour?","115":"Would you, perchance, ask of the Apostle who has been sent unto you what was asked aforetime of Moses? But whoever chooses to deny the [evidence of the] truth, instead of believing in it, has already strayed from the right path.","116":"Out of their selfish envy, many among the followers of earlier revelation would like to bring you back to denying the truth after you have attained to faith - [even] after the truth has become clear unto them. None the less, forgive and forbear, until God shall make manifest His will: behold, God has the power to will anything.","117":"And be constant in prayer, and render the purifying dues; for, whatever good deed you send ahead for your own selves, you shall find it with God: behold, God sees all that you do.","118":"AND THEY claim, \"None shall ever enter paradise unless he be a Jew\" - or, \"a Christian\". Such are their wishful beliefs! Say: \"Produce an evidence for what you are claiming, if what you say is true!\"","119":"Yea, indeed: everyone who surrenders his whole being unto God, and is a doer of good withal, shall have his reward with his Sustainer; and all such need have no fear, and neither shall they grieve.","120":"Furthermore, the Jews assert, \"The Christians have no valid ground for their beliefs,\" while the Christians assert, \"The Jews have no valid ground for their beliefs\" - and both quote the divine writ! Even thus, like unto what they say, have [always] spoken those who were devoid of knowledge;\" but it is God who will judge between them on Resurrection Day with regard to all on which they were wont to differ.","121":"Hence, who could be more wicked than those who bar the mention of God's name from [any of] His houses of worship and strive for their ruin, [although] they have no right to enter them save in fear [of God]? For them, in this world, there is ignominy in store; and for them, in the life to come, awesome suffering.","122":"And God's is the east and the west: and wherever you turn, there is God's countenance. Behold, God is infinite, all-knowing.","123":"And yet some people assert, \"God has taken unto Himself a son!\" Limitless is He in His glory! Nay, but His is all that is in the heavens and on earth; all things devoutly obey His will.","124":"The Originator is He of the heavens and the earth: and when He wills a thing to be, He but says unto it, \"Be\" -and it is.","125":"AND [only] those who are devoid of knowledge say, \"Why does God not speak unto us, nor is a [miraculous] sign shown to us?\" Even thus, like unto what they, say, spoke those who lived before their time their hearts are all alike. Indeed, We have made all the signs manifest unto people who are endowed with inner certainty.","126":"Verily, We have sent thee [O Prophet] with the truth, as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner: and thou shalt not be held accountable for those who are destined for the blazing fire.","127":"For, never will the Jews be pleased with thee. nor yet the Christians, unless thou follow their own creeds. Say: \"Behold, God's guidance is the only true guidance.\" And, indeed, if thou shouldst follow their errant views after all the knowledge that has come unto thee. thou wouldst have none to protect thee from God, and none to bring thee succour.","128":"Those unto whom We have vouchsafed the divine writ [and who] follow it as it ought to be followed -it is they who [truly] believe in it; whereas all who choose to deny its truth -it is they, they who are the losers!","129":"O CHILDREN of Israel! Remember those blessings of Mine with which I graced you, and how I favoured you above all other people;","130":"and remain conscious of [the coming of] a Day when no human being shall in the least avail another, nor shall ransom be accepted from any of them, nor shall intercession be of any use to them, and none shall be succoured.","131":"And [remember this:] when his Sustainer tried Abraham by [His] commandments and the latter fulfilled them, He said: \"Behold, I shall make thee a leader of men. \"Abraham asked: \"And [wilt Thou make leaders] of my offspring as well? \"[God] answered: \"My covenant does not embrace the evildoers.\"","132":"AND LO! We made the Temple a goal to which people might repair again and again, and a sanctuary: take then, the place whereon Abraham once stood as your place of prayer.\" And thus did We command Abraham and Ishmael: \"Purify My Temple for those who will walk around it, and those who will abide near it in meditation, and those who will bow down and prostrate themselves [in prayer].\"","133":"And, lo, Abraham prayed: \"O my Sustainer! Make this a land secure, and grant its people fruitful sustenance - such of them as believe in God and the Last Day.\" [God] answered: \"And whoever shall deny the truth, him will I let enjoy himself for a short while -but in the end I shall drive him to suffering through fire: and how vile a journey's end!\"","134":"And when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundations of the Temple, [they prayed:] \"O our Sustainer! Accept Thou this from us: for, verily, Thou alone art all-hearing, all-knowing!","135":"\"O our Sustainer! Make us surrender ourselves unto Thee, and make out of our offspring a community that shall surrender itself unto Thee, and show us our ways of worship, and accept our repentance: for, verily, Thou alone art the Acceptor of Repentance, the Dispenser of Grace!","136":"\"O our Sustainer! Raise up from the midst of our off spring an apostle from among themselves, who shall convey unto them Thy messages, and impart unto them revelation as well as wisdom, and cause them to grow in purity: for, verily, Thou alone art almighty, truly wise!\"","137":"And who, unless he be weak of mind, would want to abandon Abraham's creed, seeing that We have indeed raised him high in this world, and that, verily, in the life to come he shall be among the righteous?","138":"When his Sustainer said to him, \"Surrender thyself unto Me!\" - he answered, \"I have surrendered myself unto [Thee,] the Sustainer of all the worlds.\"","139":"And this very thing did Abraham bequeath unto his children, and [so did] Jacob: \"O my children! Behold, God has granted you the purest faith; so do not allow death to overtake you ere you have surrendered yourselves unto Him.\"","140":"Nay, but you [yourselves, O children of Israel,] bear witness that when death was approaching Jacob, he said unto his sons: \"Whom will you worship after I am gone?\" They answered: \"We will worship thy God, the God of thy forefathers Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac, the One God; and unto Him we surrender ourselves.\"","141":"Now those people have passed away; unto them shall be accounted what they have earned, and unto you, what you have earned; and you will not be, judged on the strength of what they did.","142":"AND THEY say, \"Be Jews\" - or, \"Christians\" - \"and you shall be on the right path.\" Say: \"Nay, but [ours is] the creed of Abraham, who turned away from all that is false, and was not of those who ascribe divinity to aught beside God.\"","143":"Say: \"We believe in God, and in that which has been bestowed from on high upon us, and that which has been bestowed upon Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and, their descendants, and that which has been vouchsafed to Moses and Jesus; and that which has been vouchsafed to all the [other] prophets by their Sustainer: we make no distinction between any of them. And it is unto Him that we surrender ourselves.\"","144":"And if [others] come to believe in the way you believe, they will indeed find themselves on the right path; and if they turn away, it is but they who will be deeply in the wrong, and God will protect thee from them: for He alone is all-hearing, all-knowing.","145":"[Say: \"Our life takes its] hue from God! And who could give a better hue [to life] than God, if we but truly worship Him?\"","146":"Say [to the Jews and the Christians]: \"Do you argue with us about God? But He is our Sustainer as well as your Sustainer - and unto us shall be accounted our deeds, and unto you, your deeds; and it- is unto Him alone that we devote ourselves.","147":"\"Do you claim that Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and their descendants were `Jews' or `Christians'?\" Say: \"Do you know more than God does? And who could be more wicked than he who suppresses a testimony given to him by God? Yet God is not unmindful of what you do.","148":"\"Now those people have passed away; unto them shall be accounted what they have earned, and unto you, what you have earned; and you will not be judged on the strength of what they did.\"","149":"THE WEAK-MINDED among people will say, \"What has turned them away from the direction of prayer which they have hitherto observed?\" Say: \"God's is the east and the west; He guides whom He wills onto a straight way.\"","150":"And thus have We willed you to be a community of the middle way, so that [with your lives] you might bear witness to the truth before all mankind, and that the Apostle might bear witness to it before you. And it is only to the end that We might make a clear distinction between those who follow the Apostle and those who turn about on their heels that We have appointed [for this community] the direction of prayer which thou [O Prophet] hast formerly observed: for this was indeed a hard test for all but those whom God has guided aright. But God will surely not lose sight of your faith-for, behold, God is most compassionate towards man, a dispenser of grace.","151":"We have seen thee [O Prophet] often turn thy face towards heaven [for guidance]: and now We shall indeed make thee turn in prayer in a direction which will fulfil thy desire. Turn, then, thy face towards the Inviolable House of Worship; and wherever you all may be, turn your faces towards it [in prayer]. And, verily, those who have been vouchsafed revelation aforetime know well that this [commandment] comes in truth from their Sustainer; and God is not unaware of what they do.","152":"And yet, even if thou wert to place all evidence before those who have been vouchsafed earlier revelation, they would not follow thy direction of prayer; and neither mayest thou follow their direction of prayer, nor even do they follow one another's direction. And if thou shouldst follow their errant views after all the knowledge that has come unto thee thou wouldst surely be among the evildoers.","153":"They unto whom We have vouchsafed revelation aforetime know it as they know their own children: but, behold, some of them knowingly suppress the truth -","154":"the truth from thy Sustainer! Be not, then, among the doubters:","155":"for, every community faces a direction of its own, of which He is the focal point. Vie, therefore, with one another in doing good works. Wherever you may be, God will gather you all unto Himself: for, verily, God has the power to will anything.","156":"Thus, from wherever thou mayest come forth, turn thy face [in prayer] towards the Inviolable House of Worship-for,. behold, this [commandment] comes in truth from thy Sustainer; and God is not unaware of what you do.","157":"Hence, from wherever thou mayest come forth, turn thy face [in prayer] towards the Inviolable House of Worship; and wherever you all may be, turn your faces towards it, so that people should have no argument against you unless they are bent upon wrongdoing. And hold not them in awe, but stand in awe of Me, and [obey Me,] so that I might bestow upon you the full measure of My blessings., and that you might follow the right path.","158":"Even as We have sent unto you an apostle from among yourselves to convey unto you Our messages, and to cause you to grow in purity, and to impart unto you revelation and wisdom, and to teach you that which you knew not:","159":"so remember Me, and I shall remember you; and be grateful unto Me, and deny Me not.","160":"O YOU who have attained to faith! Seek aid in steadfast patience and prayer: for, behold, God is with those who are patient in adversity.","161":"And say not of those who are slain in God's cause, \"They are dead\": nay, they are alive, but you perceive it not.","162":"And most certainly shall We try you by means of danger, and hunger, and loss of worldly goods, of lives and of [labour's] fruits.

Partake of what is lawful and good on earth, and follow not Satan's footsteps: for, verily, he is your open foe,","176":"and bids you only to do evil, and to commit deeds of abomination, and to attribute unto God something of which you have no knowledge.","177":"But when they are told, \"Follow what God has bestowed from on high,\" some answer, \"Nay, we shall follow [only] that which we found our forefathers believing in and doing.\" Why, even if their forefathers did not use their reason at all, and were devoid of all guidance?","178":"And so, the parable of those who re bent on denying the truth is that of the beast which hears the shepherd's cry, and hears in it nothing but the sound of a voice and a call.

Partake of the good things which We have provided for you as sustenance, and render thanks unto God, if it is [truly] Him that you worship.","180":"He has forbidden to you only carrion, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that over which any name other than God's has been invoked; but if one is driven by necessity - neither coveting it nor exceeding his immediate need -no sin shall be upon him: for, behold, God is much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace.","181":"VERILY, as for those who suppress aught of the revelation which God has bestowed from on high, and barter it away for a trifling gain - they but fill their bellies with fire. And God will not speak unto them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He cleanse them [of their sins]; and grievous suffering awaits them.","182":"It is they who take error in exchange for guidance, and suffering in exchange for forgiveness: yet how little do they seem to fear the fire!","183":"Thus it is: since it is God who bestows the divine writ from on high, setting forth the truth, all those who set their own views against the divine writ are, verily, most deeply in the wrong.","184":"True piety does not consist in turning your faces towards the east or the west - but truly pious is he who believes in God, and the Last Day; and the angels, and revelation, and the prophets; and spends his substance - however much he himself may cherish - it - upon his near of kin, and the orphans, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and the beggars, and for the freeing of human beings from bondage; and is constant in prayer, and renders the purifying dues; and [truly pious are] they who keep their promises whenever they promise, and are patient in misfortune and hardship and in time of peril: it is they that have proved themselves true, and it is they, they who are conscious of God.","185":"O YOU who have attained to faith! Just retribution is ordained for you in cases of killing: the free for the free, and the slave for the slave, and the woman for the woman. And if something [of his guilt] is remitted to a guilty person by his brother, this [remission] shall be adhered to with fairness, and restitution to his fellow-man shall be made in a goodly manner. This is an alleviation from your Sustainer, and an act of His grace. And for him who, none the less, wilfully transgresses the bounds of what is right, there is grievous suffering in store:","186":"for, in [the law of] just retribution, O you who are endowed with insight, there is life for you, so that you might remain conscious of God!","187":"IT IS ordained for you, when death approaches any of you and he is leaving behind much wealth, to make bequests in favour of his parents and [other] near of kin in accordance with what is fair: I this is binding on all who are conscious of God.","188":"And if anyone alters such a provision - after having come to know it, the sin of acting thus shall fall only upon those who have altered it.

Fasting is ordained for you as it was ordained for those before you, so that you might remain conscious of God:","191":"[fasting] during a certain number of days. But whoever of you is ill, or on a journey, [shall fast instead for the same] number of other days; and [in such cases] it is incumbent upon those who can afford it to make sacrifice by feeding a needy person. And whoever does more good than he is bound to do does good unto himself thereby; for to fast is to do good unto yourselves - if you but knew it.","192":"It was the month of Ramadan in which the Qur'an was [first] bestowed from on high as a guidance unto man and a self-evident proof of that guidance, and as the standard by which to discern the true from the false.

God wills that you shall have ease, and does not will you to suffer hardship; but [He desires] that you complete the number [of days required], and that you extol God for His having guided you aright, and that you render your thanks [unto Him].","193":"AND IF My servants ask thee about Me - behold, I am near; I respond to the call of him who calls, whenever he calls unto Me: let them, then, respond unto Me, and believe in Me, so that they might follow the right way.","194":"IT IS lawful for you to go in unto your wives during the night preceding the [day's] fast: they are as a garment for you, and you are as a garment for them. God is aware that you would have deprived yourselves of this right, and so He has turned unto you in His mercy and removed this hardship from you. Now, then, you may lie with them skin to skin, and avail yourselves of that which God has ordained for you, and eat and drink until you can discern the white streak of dawn against the blackness of night, and then resume fasting until nightfall; but do not lie with them skin to skin when you are about to abide in meditation in houses of worship. These are the bounds set by God: do not, then, offend against them - [for] it is thus that God makes clear His messages unto mankind, so that they might remain conscious of Him.","195":"AND DEVOUR NOT one another's possessions wrongfully, and neither employ legal artifices with a view to devouring sinfully, and knowingly, anything that by right belongs to others.","196":"THEY WILL ASK thee about the new moons. Say: \"They indicate the periods for [various doings of] mankind, including the pilgrimage.\" However, piety does not consist in your entering houses from the rear, [as it were,] but truly pious is he who is conscious of God. Hence, enter houses through their doors, and remain conscious of God, so that you might attain to a happy state.","197":"AND FIGHT in God's cause against those who wage war against you, but do not commit aggression-for, verily, God does not love aggressors.","198":"And slay them wherever you may come upon them, and drive them away from wherever they drove you away - for oppression is even worse than killing. And fight not against them near the Inviolable House of Worship unless they fight against you there first; but if they fight against you, slay them: such shall be the recompense of those who deny the truth.","199":"But if they desist-behold, God is much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace.","200":"Hence, fight against them until there is no more oppression and all worship is devoted to God alone; but if they desist, then all hostility shall cease, save against those who [wilfully] do wrong.","201":"Fight during the sacred months if you are attacked: for a violation of sanctity is [subject to the law of] just retribution. Thus, if anyone commits aggression against you, attack him just as he has attacked you - but remain conscious of God, and know that God is with those who are conscious of Him.","202":"And spend [freely] in God's cause, and let not your own hands throw you into destruction; and persevere in doing good: behold, God loves the doers of good.","203":"AND PERFORM the pilgrimage and the pious visit [to Mecca] in honour of God; and if you are held back, give instead whatever offering you can easily afford. And do not shave your heads until the offering has been sacrificed; but he from among you who is ill or suffers from an ailment of the head shall redeem himself by fasting, or alms, or [any other] act of worship. And if you are hale and secure, then he who takes advantage of a pious visit before the [time of] pilgrimage shall give whatever offering he can easily afford; whereas he who cannot afford it shall fast for three days during the pilgrimage and for seven days after your return: that is, ten full [days]. All this relates to him who does not live near the Inviolable House of Worship. And remain conscious of God, and know that God is severe in retribution.","204":"The pilgrimage shall take place in the months appointed for it. And whoever undertakes the pilgrimage in those [months] shall, while on pilgrimage, abstain from lewd speech, from all wicked conduct, and from quarrelling; and whatever good you may do, God is aware of it. And make provision for yourselves - but, verily, the best of all provisions is God-consciousness: remain, then, conscious of Me, O you who are endowed with insight!","205":"[However,] you will be committing no sin if [during the pilgrimage] you seek to obtain any bounty from your Sustainer. And when you surge downward in multitudes from `Arafat, remember God at the holy place, and remember Him as the One who guided you after you had indeed been lost on your way;","206":"and surge onward together with the multitude of all the other people who surge onward, and ask God to forgive you your sins: for, verily, God is much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace.","207":"And when you have performed your acts of worship, [continue to] bear God in mind as you would bear your own fathers in mind-nay, with a yet keener remembrance! For there are people who [merely] pray, \"O our Sustainer! Give us in this world\" -and such shall not partake in the blessings of the life to come.","208":"But there are among them such as pray, \"O our Sustainer! Grant us good in this world and good in the life to come, and keep us safe from suffering through the fire\":","209":"it is these. that shall have their portion [of happiness] in return for what they have earned. And God is swift in reckoning.","210":"And bear God in mind during the appointed days; but he who hurries away within two days shall incur no sin, and he who tarries longer shall incur no sin, provided that he is conscious of God. Hence, remain conscious of God, and know that unto Him you shall be gathered.","211":"NOW THERE IS a kind of man whose views on the life of this world may please thee greatly, and [the more so as] he cites God as witness to what is in his heart and is, moreover, exceedingly skillful in argument.","212":"But whenever he prevails, he goes about the earth spreading corruption and destroying [man's] tilth and progeny: and God does not love corruption.","213":"And whenever he is told, \"Be conscious of God,\" his false pride drives him into sin: wherefore hell will be his allotted portion-and how vile a resting-place!","214":"But there is [also] a kind of man who would willingly sell his own self in order to please God: and God is most compassionate towards His servants.","215":"O you who have attained to faith! Surrender yourselves wholly unto God, and follow not Satan's footsteps, for, verily, he is your open foe.","216":"And if you should stumble after all evidence of the truth has come unto you, then know that, verily, God is almighty, wise.","217":"Are these people waiting, perchance, for God to reveal Himself unto them in the shadows of the clouds, together with the angels - although [by then] all will have been decided, and unto God all things will have been brought back?","218":"Ask the children of Israel how many a clear message We have given them! And if one alters God's blessed message after it has reached him - verily, God is severe in retribution!","219":"Unto those who are bent on denying the truth the life of this world [alone] seems goodly; hence, they scoff at those who have attained to faith: but they who are conscious of God shall be above them on Resurrection Day. And God grants sustenance unto whom He wills, beyond all reckoning.","220":"ALL MANKIND were once one single community; [then they began to differ -] whereupon God raised up the prophets as heralds of glad tidings and as warners, and through them bestowed revelation from on high, setting forth the truth, so that it might decide between people with regard to all on which they had come to hold divergent views. Yet none other than the selfsame people who had been granted this [revelation] began, out of mutual jealousy, to disagree about its meaning after all evidence of the truth had come unto them. But God guided the believers unto the truth about which, by His leave, they had disagreed: for God guides onto a straight way him that wills [to be guided].","221":"[But] do you think that you could enter para-dise without having suffered like those [believers] who passed away before you?

But if any of you should turn away from his faith and die as a denier of the truth - these it is whose works will go for nought in this world and in the life to come; and these it is who are destined for the fire, therein to abide.","225":"Verily, they who have attained to faith, and they who have forsaken the domain of evil and are striving hard in God's cause - these it is who may look forward to God's grace: for God is much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace.","226":"THEY WILL ASK thee about intoxicants and games of chance. Say: \"In both there is great evil as well as some benefit for man; but the evil which they cause is greater than the benefit which they bring.\" And they will ask thee as to what they should spend [in God's cause]. Say: \"Whatever you can spare.\" In this way God makes clear unto you His messages, so that you might reflect","227":"on this world and on the life to come. And they will ask thee about [how to deal with] orphans.

[Such as] these invite unto the fire, whereas God invites unto paradise, and unto [the achievement of] forgiveness by His leave; and He makes clear His messages unto mankind, so that they might bear them in mind.","229":"AND THEY will ask thee about [woman's] monthly courses. Say: \"It is a vulnerable condition. Keep, therefore, aloof from women during their monthly courses, and do not draw near unto them until they are cleansed; and when they are cleansed, go in unto them as God has bidden you to do.\" Verily, God loves those who turn unto Him in repentance and He loves those who keep themselves pure.","230":"Your wives are your tilth; go, then, unto your tilth as you may desire, but first provide something for your souls, and remain conscious of God, and know that you are destined to meet Him.

And as soon as he and those who had kept faith with him had crossed the river, the others said: \"No strength have we today [to stand up] against Goliath and his forces!\" [Yet] those who knew with certainty that they were destined to meet God, replied: \"How often has a small host overcome a great host by God's leave! For God is with those who are patient in adversity.\"","257":"And when they came face to face with Goliath and his forces, they prayed: \"O our Sustainer! Shower us with patience in adversity, and make firm our steps, and succour us against the people who deny the truth!\"","258":"And thereupon, by God's leave, they routed them. And David slew Goliath; and God bestowed upon him dominion, and wisdom, and imparted to him the knowledge of whatever He willed. And if God had not enabled people to defend themselves against one another, corruption would surely overwhelm the earth: but God is limitless in His bounty unto all the worlds.","259":"THESE are God's messages: We convey them unto thee, [O Prophet,] setting forth the truth-for, verily, thou art among those who have been entrusted with a message.","260":"Some of these apostles have We endowed more highly than others: among them were such as were spoken to by God [Himself], and some He has raised yet higher.' And We vouchsafed unto Jesus, the son of Mary, all evidence of the truth, and strengthened him with holy inspiration. And if God had so willed, they who succeeded those [apostles] would not have contended with one another after all evidence of the truth had come to them; but [as it was,] they did take to divergent views, and some of them attained to faith, while some of them came to deny the truth. Yet if God had so willed, they would not have contended with one another: but God does whatever He wills.","261":"O YOU who have attained to faith! Spend [in Our way] out of what We have granted you as sustenance ere there come a Day when there will be no bargaining, and no friendship, and no intercession.

His is all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth. Who is there that could intercede with Him, unless it be by His leave? He knows all that lies open before men and all that is hidden from them, whereas they cannot attain to aught of His knowledge save that which He wills [them to attain]. His eternal power overspreads the heavens and the earth, and their upholding wearies Him not. And he alone is truly exalted, tremendous.","263":"THERE SHALL BE no coercion in matters of faith. Distinct has now become the right way from [the way of] error: hence, he who rejects the powers of evil and believes in God has indeed taken hold of a support most unfailing, which shall never give way: for God is all-hearing, all-knowing.","264":"God is near unto those who have faith, taking them out of deep darkness into the light - whereas near unto those who are bent on denying the truth are the powers of evil that take them out of the light into darkness deep: it is they who are destined for the fire, therein to abide.","265":"ART THOU NOT aware of that [king] who argued with Abraham about his Sustainer, (simply] because God had granted him kingship?

Abraham said: \"My Sustainer is He who grants life and deals death.\" [The king] replied: \"I [too] grant life and deal death!\" Said Abraham: \"Verily, God causes the sun to rise in the east; cause it, then, to rise in the west!\" Thereupon he who was bent on denying the truth remained dumbfounded: for God does not guide people who [deliberately] do wrong.","266":"Or [art thou, O man, of the same mind] as he who passed by a town deserted by its people, with its roofs caved in, [and] said, \"How could God bring all this back to life after its death?\" Thereupon God caused him to be dead for a hundred years; where after He brought him back to life [and] said: \"How long hast thou remained thus?\" He answered: \"I have remained thus a day, or part of a day.\" Said [God]: \"Nay, but thou hast remained thus for a hundred years! But look at thy food and thy drink-untouched is it by the passing of years - and look at thine ass! And [We did all this so that We might make thee a symbol unto men.

Do not deprive your charitable deeds of all worth by stressing your own benevolence and hurting [the feelings of the needy], as does he who spends his wealth only to be seen and praised by men, and believes not in God and the Last Day: for his parable is that of a smooth rock with [a little] earth upon it - and then a rainstorm smites it and leaves it hard and bare. Such as these shall have no gain whatever from all their [good] works: for God does not guide people who refuse to acknowledge the truth.","272":"And the parable of those who spend their possessions out of a longing to please God, and out of their own inner certainty, is that of a garden on high, fertile ground: a rainstorm smites it, and thereupon it brings forth its fruit twofold; and if no rainstorm smites it, soft rain [falls upon it]. And God sees all that you do.","273":"Would any of you like to have a garden of date-palms and vines, through which running waters flow, and have all manner of fruit therein - and then be overtaken by old age, with only weak children to [look after] him-and then [see] it smitten by a fiery whirlwind and utterly scorched? In this way God makes clear His messages unto you, so that you might take thought.","274":"O you who have attained to faith! Spend on others out of the good things which you may have acquired, and out of that which We bring forth for you from the earth; and choose not for your spending the bad things which you yourselves would not accept without averting your eyes in disdain. And know that God is self-sufficient, ever to be praised.","275":"Satan threatens you with the prospect of poverty and bids you to be niggardly, whereas God promises you His forgiveness and bounty; and God is infinite, all-knowing,","276":"granting wisdom unto whom He wills: and whoever is granted wisdom has indeed been granted wealth abundant. But none bears this in mind save those who are endowed with insight.","277":"For, whatever you may spend on others, or whatever you may vow [to spend], verily, God knows it; and those who do wrong [by withholding charity] shall have none to succour them.","278":"If you do deeds of charity openly, it is well; but if you bestow it upon the needy in secret, it will be even better for you, and it will atone for some of your bad deeds. And God is aware of all that you do.","279":"It is not for thee [O Prophet] to make people follow the right path, since it is God [alone] who guides whom He wills. And whatever good you may spend on others is for your own good, provided that you spend only out of a longing for God's countenance: for, whatever good you may spend will be repaid unto you in full, and you shall not be wronged.","280":"[And give] unto [such of] the needy who, being wholly wrapped up in God's cause, are unable to go about the earth [in search of livelihood]. He who is unaware [of their condition] might think that they are wealthy, because they abstain [from begging]; [but] thou canst recognize them by their special mark: they do not beg of men with importunity. And whatever good you may spend [on them], verily, God knows it all.","281":"Those who spend their possessions [for the sake of God] by night and by day, secretly and openly, shall have their reward with their Sustainer; and no fear need they have, and neither shall they grieve.","282":"THOSE who gorge themselves on usury behave but as he might behave whom Satan has confounded with his touch; for they say, \"Buying and selling is but a kind of usury\" - the while God has made buying and selling lawful and usury unlawful.

And if he who contracts the debt is weak of mind or body, or, is not able to dictate himself, then let him who watches over his interests dictate equitably. And call upon two of your men to act as witnesses; and if two men are not available, then a man and two women from among such as are acceptable to you as witnesses, so that if one of them should make a mistake, the other could remind her. And the witnesses must not refuse [to give evidence] whenever they are called upon. And be not loath to write down every contractual provision, be it small or great, together with the time at which it falls due; this is more equitable in the sight of God, more reliable as evidence, and more likely to prevent you from having doubts [later]. If, however, [the transaction] concerns ready merchandise which you transfer directly unto one another, you will incur no sin if you do not write it down. And have witnesses whenever you trade with one another, but neither scribe nor witness must suffer harm; for if you do [them harm], behold, it will be sinful conduct on your part. And remain conscious of God, since it is God who teaches you [herewith] - and God has full knowledge of everything.","290":"And if you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, pledges [may be taken] in hand: but if you trust one another, then let him who is trusted fulfil his trust, and let him be conscious of God, his Sustainer. And do not conceal what you have witnessed - for, verily, he who conceals it is sinful at heart; and God has full knowledge of all that you do.","291":"Unto God belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth. And whether you bring into the open what is in your minds or conceal it, God will call you to account for it; and then He will forgive whom He wills, and will chastise whom He wills: for God has the power to will anything.","292":"THE APOSTLE, and the believers with him, believe in what has been bestowed upon him from on high by his Sustainer: they all believe in God, and His angels, and His revelations, and His apostles, making no distinction between any of His apostles; and they say: We have heard, and we pay heed.

Do you\" - said He - \"acknowledge and accept My bond on this condition?\" They answered: \"We do acknowledge it.\" Said He: \"Then bear witness [thereto], and I shall be your witness.","375":"And, henceforth, all who turn away [from this pledge] - it is they, they who are truly iniquitous!\"","376":"Do they seek, perchance, a faith other than in God, although it is unto Him that whatever is in the heavens and on earth surrenders itself, willingly or unwillingly, since unto Him all must return?","377":"Say: \"We believe in God, and in that which has been bestowed from on high upon us, and that which has been bestowed upon Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and their descendants, and that which has been vouchsafed by their Sustainer unto Moses and Jesus and all the [other] prophets: we make no distinction between any of them.

It is they for whom grievous suffering is in store; and they shall have none to succour them.","385":"[But as for you, O believers,] never shall you attain to true piety unless you spend on others out of what you cherish yourselves; and whatever you spend - verily, God has full knowledge thereof.","386":"ALL FOOD was lawful unto the children of Israel, save what Israel had made unlawful unto itself [by its sinning] before the Torah was bestowed from on high.

Be conscious of God with all the consciousness that is due to Him, and do not allow death to overtake you ere you have surrendered yourselves unto Him.","396":"And hold fast, all together, unto the bond with God, and do not draw apart from one another. And remember the blessings which God has bestowed upon you: how, when you were enemies, He brought your hearts together, so that through His blessing you became brethren; and [how, when] you were on the brink of a fiery abyss. He saved you from it. In this way God makes clear His messages unto you, so that you might find guidance,","397":"and that there might grow out of you a community [of people] who invite unto all that is good, and enjoin the doing of what is right and forbid the doing of what is wrong: and it is they, they who shall attain to a happy state!","398":"And be not like those who have drawn apart from one another and have taken to conflicting views after all evidence of the truth has come unto them: for these it is for whom tremendous suffering is in store","399":"on the Day [of Judgment] when some faces will shine [with happiness] and some faces will be dark [with grief].

Do not take for your bosom-friends people who are not of your kind. They spare no effort to corrupt you; they would love to see you in distress.

Behold, God has full knowledge of what is in the hearts [of men]!\"","413":"If good fortune comes to you, it grieves them; and if evil befalls you, they rejoice in it. But if you are patient in adversity and conscious of God, their guile cannot harm you at all: for, verily, God encompasses [with His might] all that they do.","414":"AND [remember, O Prophet, the day] when thou didst set out from thy home at early morn to place the believers in battle array. And God was all-hearing, all-knowing","415":"when two groups from among you were about to lose heart, although God was near unto them and it is in God that the believers must place their trust:","416":"for, indeed, God did succour you at Badr, when you were utterly weak.

Do not gorge yourselves on usury, doubling and re-doubling it - but remain conscious of God, so that you might attain to a happy state;","424":"and beware of the fire which awaits those who deny the truth!","425":"And pay heed unto God and the Apostle, so that you might be graced with mercy.","426":"And vie with one another to attain to your Sustainer's forgiveness and to a paradise as vast as the heavens and the earth, which has been readied for the God-conscious","427":"who spend [in His way] in time of plenty and in time of hardship, and hold in check their anger, and pardon their fellow-men because God loves the doers of good;","428":"and who, when they have committed a shameful deed or have [otherwise] sinned against themselves, remember God and pray that their sins be forgiven - for who but God could forgive sins? - and do not knowingly persist in doing whatever [wrong] they may have done.","429":"These it is who shall have as their reward forgiveness from their Sustainer, and gardens through which running waters flow, therein to abide: and how excellent a reward for those who labour!","430":"[MANY] WAYS of life have passed away before your time. Go, then, about the earth and behold what happened in the end to those who gave the lie to the truth:","431":"this [should be] a clear lesson unto all men, and a guidance and an admonition unto the God-conscious.","432":"Be not, then, faint of heart, and grieve not: for you are bound to rise high if you are [truly] believers.","433":"If misfortune touches you, [know that] similar misfortune has touched [other] people as well; for it is by turns that We apportion unto men such days [of fortune and misfortune]: and [this] to the end that God might mark out those who have attained to faith, and choose from among you such as [with their lives] bear witness to the truth - since God does not love evildoers -","434":"and that God might render pure of all dross those who have attained to faith, and bring to nought those who deny the truth.","435":"Do you think that you could enter paradise unless God takes cognizance of your having striven hard [in His cause], and takes cognizance of your having been patient in adversity?","436":"For, indeed, you did long for death [in God’s cause] before you came face to face with it; and now you have seen it with your own eyes!","437":"AND MUHAMMAD is only an apostle; all the [other] apostles have passed away before him: if, then, he dies or is slain, will you turn about on your heels?

And if one desires the rewards of this world, We shall grant him thereof; and if one desires the rewards of the life to come, We shall grant him thereof; and We shall requite those who are grateful [to Us].","439":"And how many a prophet has had to fight [in God's cause], followed by many God-devoted men: and they did not become faint of heart for all that they had to suffer in God's cause, and neither did they weaken, nor did they abase themselves [before the enemy], since God loves those who are patient in adversity;","440":"and all that they said was this: \"O our Sustainer! Forgive us our sins and the lack of moderation in our doings! And make firm our steps, and succour us against people who deny the truth!\" -","441":"whereupon God granted them the rewards of this world, as well as the goodliest rewards of the life to come: for God loves the doers of good.","442":"O YOU who have attained to faith! If you pay heed to those who are bent on denying the truth, they will cause you to turn back on your heels, and you will be the losers.","443":"Nay, but God alone is your Lord Supreme, and His is the best succour.","444":"Into the hearts of those who are bent on denying the truth We shall cast dread in return for their ascribing divinity, side by side with God, to other beings - [something] for which He has never bestowed any warrant from on high; and their goal is the fire - and how evil that abode of evildoers!","445":"AND, INDEED, God made good His promise unto you when, by His leave, you were about to destroy your foes - until the moment when you lost heart and acted contrary to the [Prophet's] command, and disobeyed after He had brought you within view of that [victory] for which you were longing. There were among you such as cared for this world [alone], just as there were among you such as cared for the life to come: whereupon, in order that He might put you to a test, He prevented you from defeating your foes. But now He has effaced your sin: for God is limitless in His bounty unto the believers.","446":"[Remember the time] when you fled, paying no heed to anyone, while at your rear the Apostle was calling out to you - wherefore He requited you with woe in return for [the Apostle's] woe, so that you should not grieve [merely] over what had escaped you, nor over what had befallen you: for God is aware of all that you do.","447":"Then, after this woe, He sent down upon you a sense of security, an inner calm which enfolded some of you, whereas the others, who cared mainly for themselves, entertained wrong thoughts about God - thoughts of pagan ignorance - saying, \"Did we, then, have any power of decision [in this matter]?\" Say: \"Verily, all power of decision does rest with God\" - [but as for them,] they are trying to conceal within themselves that [weakness of faith] which they would not reveal unto thee, [O Prophet, by] saying, \"If we had any power of decision, we would not have left so many dead behind.\" Say [unto them]: \"Even if you had remained in your homes, those [of you] whose death had been ordained would indeed have gone forth to the places where they were destined to lie down.\" And [all this befell you] so that God might put to a test all that you harbour in your bosoms, and render your innermost hearts pure of all dross: for God is aware of what is in the hearts [of men].","448":"Behold, as for those of you who turned away [from their duty] on the day when the two hosts met in battle - Satan caused them to stumble only by means of something that they [themselves] had done.

Be not like those who are bent on denying the truth and say of their brethren [who die] after having set out on a journey to faraway places or gone forth to war, \"Had they but remained with us, they would not have died,\" or, \"they would not have been slain\" - for God will cause such thoughts to become a source of bitter regret in their hearts, since it is God who grants life and deals death. And God sees all that you do.","450":"And if indeed you are slain or die in God's cause, then surely forgiveness from God and His grace are better than all that one could amass [in this world]:","451":"for, indeed, if you die or are slain, it will surely be unto God that you shall be gathered.","452":"And it was by God's grace that thou [O Prophet] didst deal gently with thy followers: for if thou hadst been harsh and hard of heart, they would indeed have broken away from thee. Pardon them, then, and pray that they be forgiven.

In God, then, let the believers place their trust!","454":"AND IT IS not conceivable that a prophet should deceive - since he who deceives shall be faced with his deceit on the Day of Resurrection, when every human being shall be repaid in full for whatever he has done, and none shall be wronged.","455":"Is then he who strives after God's goodly acceptance like unto him who has earned the burden of God's condemnation and whose goal is hell? - and how vile a journey's end!","456":"They are on [entirely] different levels in the sight of God; for God sees all that they do.","457":"Indeed, God bestowed a favour upon the believers when he raised up in their midst an apostle from among themselves, to convey His messages unto them, and to cause them to grow in purity, and to impart unto them the divine writ as well as wisdom - whereas before that they were indeed, most obviously, lost in error.","458":"AND DO YOU, now that a calamity has befallen you after you had inflicted twice as much [on your foes], ask yourselves, \"How has this come about?\" Say: \"It has come from your own selves.\" Verily, God has the power to will anything:","459":"and all that befell you on the day when the two hosts met in battle happened by God's leave, so that He might mark out the [true] believers,","460":"and mark out those who were tainted with hypocrisy and, when they were told, \"Come, fight in God's cause\" - or, \"Defend yourselves\" - answered, \"If we but knew [that it would come to a] fight, we would indeed follow you.\" Unto apostasy were they nearer on that day than unto faith, uttering with their mouths something which was not in their hearts, the while God knew fully well what they were trying to conceal:","461":"they who, having themselves held back [from fighting, later] said of their [slain] brethren, \"Had they but paid heed to us, they would not have been slain.\" Say: \"Avert, then, death from yourselves, if what you say is true!\"","462":"But do not think of those that have been slain in God's cause as dead. Nay, they are alive! With their Sustainer have they their sustenance,","463":"exulting in that [martyrdom] which God has bestowed upon them out of His bounty.

It is God's will that they shall have no share in the [blessings of the] life to come; and tremendous suffering awaits them.","470":"Verily, they who have bought a denial of the truth at the price of faith can in no wise harm God, whereas grievous suffering awaits them.","471":"And they should not think - they who are bent on denying the truth - that Our giving them rein is good for them: We give them rein only to let them grow in sinfulness; and shameful suffering awaits them.","472":"It is not God's will [O you who deny the truth] to abandon the believers to your way of life: [and] to that end He will set apart the bad from the good. And it is not God's will to give you insight into that which is beyond the reach of human perception: but [to that end] God elects whomsoever He wills from among His apostles. Believe, then, in God and His apostles; for if you believe and are conscious of Him, a magnificent requital awaits you.","473":"AND THEY should not think - they who niggardly cling to all that God has granted them out of His bounty - that this is good for them: nay, it is bad for them. That to which they [so] niggardly cling will, on the Day of Resurrection, be hung about their necks: for unto God [alone] belongs the heritage of the heavens and of the earth; and God is aware of all that you do.","474":"God has indeed heard the saying of those who said, \"Behold, God is poor while we are rich!\" We shall record what they have said, as well as their slaying of prophets against all right, and We shall say [unto them on Judgment Day]: \"Taste suffering through fire","475":"in return for what your own hands have wrought - for never does God do the least wrong to His creatures!\"","476":"As for those who maintain, \"Behold, God has bidden us not to believe in any apostle unless he comes unto us with burnt offerings\" - say [unto them, O Prophet]: \"Even before me there came unto you apostles with all evidence of the truth, and with that whereof you speak: why, then, did you slay them, if what you say is true?\"","477":"And if they give thee the lie - even so, before thy time, have [other] apostles been given the lie when they came with all evidence of the truth, and with books of divine wisdom, and with light-giving revelation.","478":"Every human being is bound to taste death: but only on the Day of Resurrection will you be requited in full [for whatever you have done] - whereupon he that shall be drawn away from the fire and brought into paradise will indeed have gained a triumph: for the life of this world is nothing but an enjoyment of self-delusion.","479":"You shall most certainly be tried in your possessions and in your persons; and indeed you shall hear many hurtful things from those to whom revelation was granted before your time, as well as from those who have come to ascribe divinity to other beings beside God.

And when you hand over to them their possessions, let there be witnesses on their behalf - although none can take count as God does.","500":"MEN SHALL have a share in what parents and kinsfolk leave behind, and women shall have a share in what parents and kinsfolk leave behind, whether it be little or much - a share ordained [by God].","501":"And when [other] near of kin and orphans and needy persons are present at the distribution [of inheritance], give them something thereof for their sustenance, and speak unto them in a kindly way.","502":"And let them stand in awe [of God], those [legal heirs] - who, if they [themselves] had to leave behind weak offspring, would feel fear on their account - and let them remain conscious of God, and let them speak [to the poor] in a just manner.","503":"Behold, those who sinfully devour the posses­sions of orphans but fill their bellies with fire: for [in the life to come] they will have to endure a blazing flame!","504":"CONCERNING [the inheritance of] your children, God enjoins [this] upon you: The male shall have the equal of two females’ share; but if there are more than two females, they shall have two-thirds of what [their parents] leave behind; and if there is only one daughter, she shall have one-half thereof. And as for the parents [of the deceased], each of them shall have one-sixth of what he leaves behind, in the event of his having [left] a child; but if he has left no child and his parents are his [only] heirs, then his mother shall have one-third; and if he has brothers and sisters, then his mother shall have one-sixth after [the deduction of] any bequest he may have made, or any debt [he may have incurred]. As for your parents and your children - you know not which of them is more deserving of benefit from you: [therefore this] ordinance from God. Verily, God is all-knowing, wise.","505":"And you shall inherit one-half of what your wives leave behind, provided they have left no child; but if they have left a child, then you shall have one-quarter of what they leave behind, after [the deduction of] any bequest they may have made, or any debt [they may have incurred]. And your widows shall have one-quarter of what you leave behind, provided you have left no child; but if you have left a child, then they shall have one-eighth of what you leave behind, after [the deduction of] any bequest you may have made, or any debt [you may have incurred]. And if a man or a woman has no heir in the direct line, but has a brother or a sister, then each of these two shall inherit one-sixth; but if there are more than two, then they shall share in one-third [of the inheritance], after [the deduction of] any bequest that may have been made, or any debt [that may have been incurred], neither of which having been intended to harm [the heirs].

But lawful to you are all [women] beyond these, for you to seek out, offering them of your possessions, taking them in honest wedlock, and not in fornication. And unto those with whom you desire to enjoy marriage, you shall give the dowers due to them; but you will incur no sin if, after [having agreed upon] this lawful due, you freely agree with one another upon anything [else]: behold, God is indeed all-knowing, wise.","518":"And as for those of you who, owing to cir­cumstances, are not in a position to marry free believing women, [let them marry] believing maidens from among those whom you rightfully possess. And God knows all about your faith; each one of you is an issue of the other. Marry them, then, with their people's leave, and give them their dowers in an equitable manner - they being women who give themselves in honest wedlock, not in fornication, nor as secret love-companions. And when they are married, and thereafter become guilty of immoral conduct, they shall be liable to half the penalty to which free married women are liable. This [permission to marry slave-girls applies] to those of you who fear lest they stumble into evil. But it is for your own good to persevere in patience [and to abstain from such marriages]: and God is much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace.","519":"God wants to make [all this] clear unto you, and to guide you onto the [righteous] ways of life of those who preceded you, and to turn unto you in His mercy: for God is all-knowing, wise.","520":"And God wants to turn unto you in His mercy, whereas those who follow [only] their own lusts want you to drift far away from the right path.","521":"God wants to lighten your burdens: for man has been created weak.","522":"O YOU who have attained to faith! Do not devour one another's possessions wrongfully - not even by way of trade based on mutual agreement - and do not destroy one another: for, behold, God is indeed a dispenser of grace unto you!","523":"And as for him who does this with malicious intent and a will to do wrong - him shall We, in time, cause to endure [suffering through] fire: for this is indeed easy for God.","524":"If you avoid the great sins, which you have been enjoined to shun, We shall efface your [minor] bad deeds, and shall cause you to enter an abode of glory.","525":"Hence, do not covet the bounties which God has bestowed more abundantly on some of you than on others. Men shall have a benefit from what they earn, and women shall have a benefit from what they earn. Ask, therefore, God [to give you] out of His bounty: behold, God has indeed full knowledge of everything.","526":"And unto everyone have We appointed heirs to what he may leave behind: parents, and near kinsfolk, and those to whom you have pledged your troth give them, therefore, their share. Behold, God is indeed a witness unto everything.","527":"MEN SHALL take full care of women with the bounties which God has bestowed more abundantly on the former than on the latter, and with what they may spend out of their possessions.

And had they but said, \"We have heard, and we pay heed,\" and \"Hear [us], and have patience with us,\" it would indeed have been for their own good, and more upright: but God has rejected them because of their refusal to acknowledge the truth - for it is in but few things that they believe.","540":"O you who have been granted revelation [aforetime]! Believe in what We have [now] bestowed from on high in confirmation of whatever [of the truth] you already possess, lest We efface your hopes and bring them to an end - just as We rejected those people who broke the Sabbath: for God's will is always done.","541":"VERILY, God does not forgive the ascribing of divinity to aught beside Him, although He forgives any lesser sin unto whomever He wills: for he who ascribes divinity to aught beside God has indeed contrived an awesome sin.","542":"Art thou not aware of those who consider themselves pure? Nay, but it is God who causes whomever He wills to grow in purity; and none shall be wronged by as much as a hair's breadth.","543":"Behold how they attribute their own lying inventions to God - than which there is no sin more obvious.","544":"Art thou not aware of those who, having been granted their share of the divine writ, [now] believe in baseless mysteries and in the powers of evil, and maintain that those who are bent on denying the truth are more surely guided than those who have attained to faith?","545":"It is they whom God has rejected: and he whom God rejects shall find none to succour him.","546":"Have they, perchance, a share in [God's] dominion?

Unto God you all must return; and then He will make you truly understand all that on which you were wont to differ.","718":"Hence, judge between the followers of earlier revelation in accordance with what God has bestowed from on high, and do not follow their errant views; and beware of them, lest they tempt thee away from aught that God has bestowed from on high upon thee. And if they turn away [from His commandments], then know that it is but God's will [thus] to afflict them for some of their sins: for, behold, a great many people are iniquitous indeed.","719":"Do they, perchance, desire [to be ruled by] the law of pagan ignorance? But for people who have inner certainty, who could be a better law-giver than God?","720":"O YOU who have attained to faith! Do not take the Jews and the Christians for your allies: they are but allies of one another and whoever of you allies himself with them becomes, verily, one of them; behold, God does not guide such evildoers.","721":"And yet thou canst see how those in whose hearts there is disease vie with one another for their good will, saying [to themselves], \"We fear lest fortune turn against us.\" But God may well bring about good fortune [for the believers] or any [other] event of His own devising, whereupon those [waverers] will be smitten with remorse for the thoughts which they had secretly harboured within themselves-","722":"while those who have attained to faith will say [to one another], \"Are these the selfsame people who swore by God with their most solemn oaths that they were indeed with you? In vain are all their works, for now they are lost!\"","723":"O you who have attained to faith! If you ever abandon your faith,\" God will in time bring forth [in your stead] people whom He loves and who love Him - humble towards the believers, proud towards all who deny the truth: [people] who strive hard in God's cause, and do not fear to be censured by anyone who might censure them: such is God's favour, which He grants unto whom He wills. And God is infinite, all-knowing.","724":"Behold, your only helper shall be God, and His Apostle, and those who have attained to faith - those that are constant in prayer, and render the purifying dues, and bow down [before God]:","725":"for, all who ally themselves with God and His Apostle and those who have attained to faith - behold, it is they, the partisans of God, who shall be victorious!","726":"O you who have attained to faith! Do not take for your friends such as mock at your, faith and make a jest of it-be they from among those who have been vouchsafed revelation before your time, or [from among] those who deny the truth [of revelation as such] -but remain conscious of God, if you are [truly] believers:","727":"for, when you call to prayer, they mock at it and make a jest of it-simply because they are people who do not use their reason.","728":"Say: \"O followers of earlier revelation! Do you find fault with us for no other reason than that we believe in God [alone], and in that which He has bestowed from on high upon us as well as that which He has bestowed aforetime? - or [is it only] because most of you are iniquitous?\"","729":"Say: \"Shall I tell you who, in the sight of God, deserves a yet worse retribution than these? They whom God has rejected and whom He has condemned, and whom He has turned into apes and swine because they worshipped the powers of evil: these are yet worse in station, and farther astray from the right path [than the mockers].\"","730":"For, when they come unto you, they say, \"We do believe\": whereas, in fact, they come with the resolve to deny the truth, and depart in the same state. But God is fully aware of all that they would conceal.","731":"And thou canst see many of them vie with one another in sinning and tyrannical conduct and in their swallowing of all that is evil.","732":"Why do not their men of God and their rabbis forbid them to make sinful assertions and to swallow all that is evil? Vile indeed is what they contrive!","733":"And the Jews say, \"God's hand is shackled!\" It is their own hands that are shackled; and rejected [by God] are they because of this their assertion. Nay, but wide are His hands stretched out: He dispenses [bounty] as He wills. But all that has been bestowed from on high upon thee [O Prophet] by thy Sustainer is bound to make many of them yet more stubborn in their overweening arrogance and in their denial of the truth. And so We have cast enmity and hatred among the followers of the Bible, [to last] until Resurrection Day; every time they light the fires of war, God extinguishes them; and they labour hard to spread corruption on earth: and God does not -love the spreaders of corruption.","734":"If the followers of the Bible would but attain to [true] faith and God-consciousness, We should indeed efface their [previous] bad deeds, and indeed bring them into gardens of bliss;","735":"and if they would but truly observe the Torah and the Gospel and all [the revelation] that has been bestowed from on high upon them by their Sustainer, they would indeed partake of all the blessings of heaven and earth.

You have no valid ground for your beliefs -unless you [truly] observe the Torah and the Gospel, and all that has been bestowed from on high upon you by your Sustainer!\" Yet all that has been bestowed from on high upon thee [O Prophet] by thy Sustainer is bound to make many of them yet more stubborn in their overweening arrogance and in their denial of the truth. But sorrow not over people who deny the truth:","738":"for, verily, those who have attained to faith [in this divine writ], as well as those who follow the Jewish faith, and the Sabians, and the Christians - all who believe in God and the Last Day and do righteous deeds - no fear need they have, and neither shall they grieve.","739":"INDEED, We accepted a solemn pledge from the children of Israel, and We sent apostles unto them; [but] every time an apostle came unto them with anything that was not to their liking, [they rebelled:] to some of them they gave the lie, while others they would slay,","740":"thinking that no harm would befall them; and so they became blind and deaf [of heart]. Thereafter God accepted their repentance: and again many of them became blind and deaf. But God sees all that they do.","741":"Indeed, the truth deny they who say, \"Behold, God is the Christ, son of Mary\" - seeing that the Christ [himself] said, \"O children of Israel! Worship God [alone], who is my Sustainer as well as your Sustainer.\" Behold, whoever ascribes divinity to any being beside God, unto him will God deny paradise, and his goal shall be the fire: and such evildoers will have none to succour them!","742":"Indeed, the truth deny they who say, \"Behold, God is the third of a trinity\" - seeing that there is no deity whatever save the One God. And unless they desist from this their assertion, grievous suffering is bound to befall such of them as are bent on denying the truth.","743":"Will they not, then, turn towards God in repentance, and ask His forgiveness? For God is much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace.","744":"The Christ, son of Mary, was but an apostle: all [other] apostles had passed away before him; and his mother was one who never deviated from the truth; and they both ate food [like other mortals]. Behold how clear We make these messages unto them: and then behold how perverted are their minds!","745":"Say: \"Would you worship, beside God, aught that has no power either to harm or to benefit you-when God alone is all-hearing, all-knowing?\"","746":"Say: \"O followers of the Gospel! Do not overstep the bounds [of truth] in your religious beliefs; and do not follow the errant views of people who have gone astray aforetime, and have led many [others] astray, and are still straying from the right path.\"","747":"THOSE of the children of Israel who were bent on denying the truth have [already] been cursed by the tongue of David and of Jesus, the son of Mary? this, because they rebelled [against God] and persisted in transgressing the bounds of what is right.","748":"They would not prevent one another from doing whatever hateful things they did: vile indeed was what they were wont to do!","749":"[And now] thou canst see many of them allying themselves with those who are bent on denying the truth! [So] vile indeed is what their passions make them do that God has condemned them; and in suffering shall they abide.","750":"For, if they [truly] believed in God and their Prophet and all that was bestowed upon him from on high, they would not take those [deniers of the truth] for their allies: but most of them are iniquitous.","751":"Thou wilt surely find that, of all people, the most hostile to those who believe [in this divine writ] are the Jews as well as those who are bent on ascribing divinity to aught beside God; and thou wilt surely find that, of all people, they who say, \"Behold, we are Christians,\" come closest to feeling affection for those who believe [in this divine writ]: this is so because there are priests and monks among them, and because these are not given to arrogance.","752":"For, when they come to understand what has been bestowed from on high upon this Apostle, thou canst see their eyes overflow with tears, because they recognize something of its truth; [and] they say: \"O our Sustainer! We do believe; make us one, then, with all who bear witness to the truth.","753":"And how could we fail to believe in God and in whatever truth has come unto us, when we so fervently desire that our Sustainer count us among the righteous?\"","754":"And for this their belief God will reward them with gardens through which running waters flow, therein to abide: for such is the requital of the doers of good;","755":"whereas they who are bent on denying the truth and giving the lie to Our messages - they are destined for the blazing fire.","756":"O YOU who have attained to faith! Do not deprive yourselves of the good things of life which God has made lawful to you, but do not transgress the bounds of what is right: verily, God does not love those who transgress the bounds of what is right.","757":"Thus, partake of the lawful, good things which God grants you as sustenance, and be conscious of God, in whom you believe.","758":"GOD will not take you to task for oaths which you may have uttered without thought, but He will take you to task for oaths which you have sworn in earnest. Thus, the breaking of an oath must be atoned for by feeding ten needy persons with more or less the same food as you are wont to give to your own families, or by clothing them, or by freeing a human being from bondage; and he who has not the wherewithal shall fast for three days [instead]. This shall be the atonement for your oaths whenever you have sworn [and broken them]. But be mindful of your oaths!' Thus God makes clear unto you His messages, so that you might have cause to be grateful.","759":"O YOU who have attained to faith! Intoxicants, and games of chance, and idolatrous practices, and the divining of the future are but a loathsome evil of Satan's doing:' shun it, then, so that you might attain to a happy state!","760":"By means of intoxicants and games of chance Satan seeks only to sow enmity and hatred among you, and to turn you away from the remembrance of God and from prayer. Will you not, then, desist?'","761":"Hence, pay heed unto God, and pay heed unto the Apostle, and be ever on your guard [against evil]; and if you turn away, then know that Our Apostle's only duty is a clear delivery of the message [entrusted to him].","762":"Those who have attained to faith and do righteous deeds incur no sin by partaking of whatever they may, so long as they are conscious of God and [truly] believe and do righteous deeds, and continue to be conscious of God and to believe, and grow ever more conscious of God, and persevere in doing good: for God loves the doers of good.","763":"O YOU who have attained to faith! Most certainly God will try you by means of the game which may come within the reach of your hands and your weapons [while you are on pilgrimage], so that God might mark out those who fear Him although He is beyond the reach of human perception. And as for him who, after all this, transgresses the bounds of what is right-grievous suffering awaits him!","764":"O you who have attained to faith! Kill no game while you are in the state of pilgrimage. And whoever of you kills it intentionally, [shall make] amends in cattle equivalent to what he has killed - with two persons of probity giving their judgment thereon- to be brought as an offering to the Ka`bah; or else he may atone for his sin by feeding the needy, or by the equivalent thereof in fasting: [this,] in order that. he taste the full gravity of his deed, [while] God shall have effaced the past. But whoever does it again, God will inflict His retribution on him: for God is almighty, an avenger of evil.","765":"Lawful to you is all water-game, and what the sea brings forth, as a provision for you [who are settled] as well as for travellers, although you are forbidden to hunt on land while you are in the state of pilgrimage. And be conscious of God, unto whom you shall be gathered.","766":"God has laid down that the Ka'bah, the Inviolable Temple, shall be a symbol for all mankind; and [so, too] the sacred month [of pilgrimage] and the garlanded offerings [are symbols] meant to make you aware that God is aware of all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth, and that God has full knowledge of everything.","767":"Know that God is severe in retribution -and that God is much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace.","768":"No more is the Apostle bound to do than deliver the message [entrusted to him]: and God knows all that you do openly, and all that you would conceal.","769":"Say: \"There is no comparison between the bad things and the good things, even though very many of the bad things may please thee greatly. Be, then, conscious of God, O you who are endowed with insight, so that you might attain to a happy state!\"","770":"O YOU who have attained to faith! Do not ask about matters which, if they were to be made manifest to you [in terms of law], might cause you hardship; for, if you should ask about them while the Qur'an is being revealed, they might [indeed] be made manifest to you [as laws]. God has absolved [you from any obligation] in this respect: for God is much-forgiving, forbearing.","771":"People before your time have indeed asked such questions-and in result thereof have come to deny the truth.","772":"IT IS NOT of God's ordaining that certain kinds of cattle should be marked out by superstition and set aside from the use of man; yet those who are bent on denying the truth attribute their own lying inventions to God. And most of them never use their reason:","773":"for when they are told, \"Come unto that which God has bestowed from on high, and unto the Apostle\" - they answer, \"Enough for us is that which we found our forefathers believing in and doing.\" Why, even though their forefathers knew nothing, and were devoid of all guidance?","774":"O you who have attained to faith! It is [but] for your own selves that you are responsible: those who go astray can do you no harm if you [yourselves] are on the right path. Unto God you all must return: and then He will make you [truly] understand all that you were doing [in life].","775":"O YOU who have attained to faith! Let there be witnesses to what you do when death approaches you and you are about to make bequests: two persons of probity from among your own people, or -if the pangs of death come upon you while you are travelling far from home -two other persons from [among people] other than your own. Take hold of the two after having prayed; and if you have any doubt in your mind, let each of them swear by God, \"We shall not sell this [our word] for any price, even though it were [for the sake of] a near kinsman; and neither shall we conceal aught of what we have witnessed before God -or else, may we indeed be counted among the sinful.\"","776":"But if afterwards it should come to light that the two [witnesses] have become guilty of [this very] sin, then two others - from among those whom the two former have deprived of their right - shall take their place and shall swear by God, \"Our testimony is indeed truer than the testimony of these two, and we have not transgressed the bounds of what is right - or else, may we indeed be counted among the evildoers!\"","777":"Thus it will be more likely that people will offer testimony in accordance with the truth-or else they will [have cause to] fear that their oaths will be refuted by the oaths of others. Be, then, conscious of God, and hearken [unto Him]: for God does not bestow His guidance upon iniquitous folk.","778":"ON THE DAY when God shall assemble all the apostles and shall ask, \"What response did you receive?\" -they will answer, \"We have no knowledge; verily, it is Thou alone who fully knowest all the things that are beyond the reach of a created being's perception.\"","779":"Lo! God will say: \"O Jesus, son of Mary! Remember the blessings which I bestowed upon thee and thy mother-how I strengthened thee with holy inspiration, so that thou couldst speak unto men in thy cradle, and as a grown man; and how I imparted unto thee revelation and wisdom, including the Torah and the Gospel; and how by My leave thou didst create out of clay, as it were, the shape of [thy followers'] destiny, and then didst breathe into it, so that it might become, by My leave, [their] destiny; and how thou didst heal the blind and the leper by My leave, and how thou didst raise the dead by My leave; and how I prevented the children of Israel from harming thee when thou camest unto them with all evidence of the truth, and [when] those of them who were bent on denying the truth were saying, `This is clearly nothing but deception!\"'","780":"AND [remember the time] when I inspired the white-garbed ones: Believe in Me and in My Apostle!\" They answered: \"We believe; and bear Thou witness that we have surrendered ourselves [unto Thee].\"","781":"[And,] lo, the white-garbed ones said: \"O Jesus, son of Mary! Could thy Sustainer send down unto us a repast from heaven?\" [Jesus] answered: \"Be conscious of God, if you are [truly] believers!\"","782":"Said they: \"We desire to partake thereof, so that our hearts might be set fully at rest, and that we might know that thou hast spoken the truth to us, and that we might be of those who bear witness thereto!\"","783":"Said Jesus, the son of Mary: \"O God, our Sustainer! Send down upon us a repast from heaven: it shall be an ever-recurring feast for us - for the first and the last of us -and a sign from Thee. And provide us our sustenance, for Thou art the best of providers!\"","784":"God answered: \"Verily, I [always] do send it down unto you: and so, if any of you should henceforth deny [this] truth, on him, behold, will I inflict suffering the like of which I have never [yet] inflicted upon anyone in the world!\"","785":"AND LO! God said: O Jesus, son of Mary! Didst thou say unto men, `Worship me and my mother as deities beside God'?\" [Jesus] answered: \"Limitless art Thou in Thy glory! It would not have been possible for me to say what I had no right to [say]! Had I said this, Thou wouldst indeed have known it! Thou knowest all that is within myself, whereas I know not what is in Thy Self. Verily, it is Thou alone who fully knowest all the things that are beyond the reach of a created being's perception.","786":"Nothing did I tell them beyond what Thou didst bid me [to say]: `Worship God, [who is] my Sustainer as well as your Sustainer.' And I bore witness to what they did as long as I dwelt in their midst; but since Thou hast caused me to die, Thou alone hast been their keeper: for Thou art witness unto everything.","787":"If thou cause them to suffer - verily, they are Thy servants; and if Thou forgive them - verily, Thou alone art almighty, truly wise!\"","788":"[AND on Judgment Day] God will say: \"Today, their truthfulness shall benefit all who have been true to their word: theirs shall be gardens through which running waters flow, therein to abide beyond the count of time; well-pleased is God with them, and well-pleased are they with Him: this is the triumph supreme.\"","789":"God's is the dominion over the heavens and the earth and all that they contain; and He has the power to will anything.","790":"ALL PRAISE is due to God, who has created the heavens and the earth, and brought into being deep darkness as well as light: and yet, those who are bent on denying the truth regard other powers as their Sustainer's equals!","791":"He it is who has created you out of clay, and then has decreed a term [for you] - a term known [only] to him. And yet you doubt –","792":"although He is God in the heavens and on earth, knowing all that you keep secret as well as all that you do openly, and knowing what you deserve.","793":"Yet whenever any of their Sustainer's messages comes unto them, they [who are bent on denying the truth] turn their backs upon it:","794":"and so they give the lie to this truth now that it has come unto them.

Your Sustainer has willed upon Himself the law of grace and mercy - so that if any of you does a bad deed out of ignorance, and thereafter repents and lives righteously, He shall be [found] much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace.\"","844":"And thus clearly do We spell out Our messages: and [We do it] so that the path of those who are lost in sin might be distinct [from that of the righteous].","845":"SAY [to the deniers of the truth]: \"Behold, I have been forbidden to worship those [beings] whom you invoke instead of God.\" Say: \"I do not follow your errant views -or else I should have gone astray, and should not be among those who have found the right path.\"","846":"Say: \"Behold, I take my stand on a clear evidence from my Sustainer-and [so] it is to Him that you are giving the lie! Not in my power is that which [in your ignorance] you so hastily demand: judgment rests with none but God. He shall declare the truth, since it is He who is the best judge between truth and falsehood.\"","847":"Say: \"If that which you so hastily demand were in my power, everything would indeed have been decided between me and you. But God knows best as to who is doing wrong.\"","848":"For, with Him are the keys to the things that are beyond the reach of a created being's perception: none knows them but He. And He knows all that is on land and in the sea; and not a leaf falls but He knows it; and neither is there a grain in the earth's deep darkness, nor anything: living or dead, but is recorded in [His] clear decree.","849":"And He it is who causes you to be [like] dead at night, and knows what you work in daytime; and He brings you back to life each days in order that a term set [by Him] be fulfilled. In the end, unto Him you must return: and then He will make you understand all that you were doing [in life].","850":"And He alone holds sway over His servants. And He sends forth heavenly forces to watch over you until, when death approaches any of you, Our messengers cause him to die: and they do not overlook [anyone].","851":"And they [who have died] are thereupon brought before God, their true Lord Supreme. Oh, verily, His alone is all judgment: and He is the swiftest of all reckoners!","852":"Say: \"Who is it that saves you from the dark dangers of land and sea [when] you call unto Him humbly, and in the secrecy of your hearts, `If He will but save us from this [distress], we shall most certainly be among the grateful'?\"","853":"Say: \"God [alone] can save you from this and from every distress - and still you ascribe divinity to other powers beside Him!\"","854":"Say: \"It is He alone who has the power to let loose upon you suffering from above you or from beneath your feet, or to confound you with mutual discord and let you taste the fear of one another.\" Behold how many facets we give to these messages, so that they might understand the truth.","855":"and yet, to all this thy peoples have given the lie, although it is the truth. Say [then]: \"I am not responsible for your conduct.","856":"Every tiding [from God] has a term set for its fulfilment: and in time you will come to know [the truth].\"","857":"NOW, whenever thou meet such as indulge in [blasphemous] talk about Our messages, turn thy back upon them until they begin to talk of other things and if Satan should ever cause thee to forget [thyself], remain not, after recollection, in the company of such evildoing folk,","858":"for whom those who are conscious of God are in no wise accountable. Theirs, however, is the duty to admonish [the sinners], so that they might become conscious of God.","859":"And leave to themselves all those who, beguiled by the life of this world, have made play and passing delights their religion; but remind [them] herewith that [in the life to come] every human being shall be held in pledge for whatever wrong he has done, and shall have none to protect him from God, and none to intercede for him; and though he offer any conceivable ransom, it shall not be accepted from him. It is [people such as] these that shall be held in pledge for the wrong they have done; for them there is [in the life to come] a draught of burning despair and grievous suffering awaits them because of their persistent refusal to acknowledge the truth.","860":"SAY: \"Shall we invoke, instead of God, something that can neither benefit us nor harm us, and [thus] turn around on our heels after God has guided us aright? -like one whom the satans have enticed into blundering after earthly lusts, the while his companions, trying to guide him, call out unto him [from afar], `Come thou to us!\"' Say: \"Verily, God's guidance is the only guidance: and so we have been bidden to surrender ourselves unto the Sustainer of all the worlds,","861":"and to be constant in prayer and conscious of Him: for it is He unto whom you all shall be gathered.\"","862":"And He it is who has created the heavens and the earth in accordance with [an inner] truth - and whenever He says, \"Be,\" His word comes true; and His will be the dominion on the Day when the trumpet [of resurrection] is blown. He knows all that is beyond the reach of a created being's perception, as well as all that can be witnessed by a creature's senses or mind: for He alone is truly wise, all-aware.","863":"AND, LO, [thus] spoke Abraham unto his father Azar: \"Takest thou idols for gods? Verily, I see that thou and thy people have obviously gone astray!\"","864":"And thus We gave Abraham [his first] insight into [God's] mighty dominion over the heavens and the earth - and [this] to the end that he might become one of those who are inwardly sure.","865":"Then, when the night overshadowed him with its darkness, he beheld a star;., [and] he exclaimed, \"This is my Sustainer!\" -but when it went down, he said, \"I love not the things that go down.\"","866":"Then, when he beheld the moon rising, he said, \"This is my Sustainer!\"-but when it went down, he said, \"Indeed, if my Sustainer guide me not. I will most certainly become one of the people who go astray!\"","867":"Then, when he beheld the sun rising, he said, \"This is my Sustainer! This one is the greatest [of all]!\" - but when it [too] went down, he exclaimed: \"O my people! Behold, far be it from me to ascribe divinity, as you do, to aught beside God!","868":"Behold, unto Him who brought into being the heavens and the earth have I turned my face, having turned away from all that is false; and I am not of those who ascribe divinity to aught beside Him.\"","869":"And his people argued with him. He said: \"Do you argue with me about God, when it is He who has guided me? But I do not fear anything to which you ascribe divinity side by side with Him, [for no evil can befall me] unless my Sustainer so wills. All things does my Sustainer embrace within His knowledge; will you not, then, keep this in mind?","870":"And why should I fear anything that you worship side by side with Him, seeing that you are not afraid of ascribing divinity to other powers beside God without His ever having bestowed upon you from on high any warrant therefor? [Tell me,] then, which of the two parties has a better right to feel secure -if you happen to know [the answer]?","871":"Those who have attained to faith, and who have not obscured their faith by wrongdoing-it is they who shall be secure, since it is they who have found the right path!\"","872":"And this was Our argument which We vouchsafed unto Abraham against his people: [for] We do raise by degrees whom We will. Verily, thy Sustainer is wise, all-knowing.","873":"And We bestowed upon him Isaac and Jacob; and We guided each of them as We had guided Noah aforetime. And out of his offspring, [We bestowed prophethood upon] David, and Solomon, and Job, and Joseph, and Moses, and Aaron: for thus do We reward the doers of good;","874":"and [upon] Zachariah, and John, and Jesus, and Elijah: every one of them was of the righteous;","875":"and [upon] Ishmael, and Elisha, and Jonah, and Lot. And every one of them did We favour above other people;","876":"and [We exalted likewise] some of their forefathers and-their offspring and their brethren: We elected them [all], and guided them onto a straight way.","877":"Such is God's guidance: He guides therewith whomever He wills of His servants. And had they ascribed divinity to aught beside Him-in vain, indeed, would have been all [the good] that they ever did:","878":"[but] it was to them that We vouchsafed revelation, and sound judgment, and prophethood.

Follow, then, their guidance, [and] say: \"No reward do I ask of you for this [truth]: behold, it is but an admonition unto all mankind!\"","880":"For, no true understanding of God have they when they say, \"Never has God revealed anything unto man.\" Say: \"Who has bestowed from on high the divine writ which Moses brought unto men as a light and a guidance, [and] which you treat as [mere] leaves of paper, making a show of them the while you conceal [so] much - although you have been taught [by it] what neither you nor your forefathers had ever known?\" Say: \"God [has revealed that divine writ]!\" - and then leave them to play at their vain talk.","881":"And this, too, is a divine writ which We have bestowed from on high - blessed, confirming the truth of whatever there still remains [of earlier revelations] -and [this] in order that thou mayest warn the foremost of all cities and all who dwell around it. And those who believe in the life to come do believe in this [warning]; and it is they who are ever-mindful of their prayers.","882":"And who could be more wicked than he who invents a lie about God, or says, \"This has been revealed unto me,\" the while nothing has been revealed to him? - or he who says, \"I, too, can bestow from on high the like of what God has bestowed\"?

Today you shall be requited with the suffering of humiliation for having attributed to God something that is not true, and for having persistently scorned His messages in your arrogance!\"","883":"[And God shall say:] \"And now, indeed, you have come unto Us in a lonely state, even as We created you in the first instance; and you have left behind you all that We bestowed on you [in your lifetime]. And We do not see with you those intercessors of yours whom you supposed to have a share in God's divinity with regard to yourselves! Indeed, all the bonds between you [and your earthly life] are now severed, and all your former fancies have forsaken you!","884":"VERILY, God is the One who cleaves the grain and the fruit-kernel asunder, bringing forth the living out of that which is dead, and He is the One who brings forth the dead out of that which is alive. This, then, is God: and yet, how perverted are your minds!","885":"[He is] the One who causes the dawn to break; and He has made the night to be [a source of] stillness, and the sun and the moon to run their appointed courses: [all] this is laid down by the will of the Almighty, the All-Knowing.","886":"And He it is who has set up for you the stars so that you might be guided by them in the midst of the deep darkness of land and sea: clearly, indeed, have We spelled out these messages unto people of [innate] knowledge!","887":"And He it is who has brought you [all] into being out of one living entity, and [has appointed for each of you] a time-limit [on earth] and a resting-place [after death]: clearly, indeed, have We spelled out these messages unto people who can grasp the truth!","888":"And He it is who has caused waters to come down from the sky; and by this means have We brought forth all living growth, and out of this have We brought forth verdure. Out of this do We bring forth close-growing grain; and out of the spathe of the palm tree, dates in thick clusters; and gardens of vines, and the olive tree, and the pomegranate: [all] so alike, and yet so different! Behold their fruit when it comes to fruition and ripens! Verily, in all this there are messages indeed for people who will believe!","889":"And yet, some [people] have come to attribute to all manner of invisible beings a place side by side with God - although it is He who has created them [all]; and in their ignorance they have invented for Him sons and daughters! Limitless is He is His glory, and sublimely exalted above anything that men may devise by way of definition:","890":"the Originator of the heavens and the earth! How could it be that He should have a child without there ever having been a mate for Him - since it is He who has created everything, and He alone knows everything?","891":"Such is God, your Sustainer: there is no deity save Him, the Creator of everything: worship, then, Him alone -for it is He who has everything in His care.","892":"No human vision can encompass Him, whereas He encompasses all human vision: for He alone is unfathomable, all-aware.","893":"Means of insight have now come unto you from your Sustainer [through this divine writ]. Whoever, therefore, chooses to see, does so for his own good; and whoever chooses to remain blind, does so to his own hurt. And [say unto the blind of heart]: \"I am not your keeper.\"","894":"And thus do We give many facets to Our messages. And to the end that they might say, \"Thou hast taken [all this] well to heart,\" and that We might make it clear unto people of [innate] knowledge,","895":"follow thou what has been revealed unto thee by thy Sustainer - save whom there is no deity - and turn thy back upon all who ascribe divinity to aught beside Him.","896":"Yet if God had so willed, they would not have ascribed divinity to aught beside Him; hence, We have not made thee their keeper, and neither art thou responsible for their conduct.","897":"But do not revile those [beings] whom they invoke instead of God, lest they revile God out of spite, and in ignorance: for, goodly indeed have We made their own doings appear unto every community In time, [however,] unto their Sustainer they must return: and then He will make them [truly] understand all that they were doing.","898":"Now they swear by God with their most solemn oaths that if a miracle were shown to them, they would indeed believe in this [divine writ].

Be not, then, among the doubters-","904":"for, truly and justly has thy Sustainer's promise been fulfilled. There is no power that could alter [the fulfilment of] His promises: and He alone is all-hearing, all-knowing.","905":"Now if thou pay heed unto the majority of those [who live] on earth, they will but lead thee astray from the path of God: they follow but [other people's] conjectures, and they themselves do nothing but guess.","906":"Verily, thy Sustainer knows best as to who strays from His path, and best knows He as to who are the right-guided.","907":"EAT, then, of that over which God's name has been pronounced, if you truly believe in His messages.","908":"And why should you not eat of that over which God's name has been pronounced, seeing that He has so clearly spelled out to you what He has forbidden you [to eat] unless you are compelled [to do so]? But, behold, [it is precisely in such matters that] many people lead others astray by their own errant views, without [having any real] knowledge. Verily, thy Sustainer is fully aware of those who transgress the bounds of what is right.","909":"But abstain from sinning, be it open or secret-for, behold, those who commit sins shall be requited for all that they have earned.","910":"Hence, eat not of that over which God's name has not been pronounced: for this would be sinful conduct indeed. And, verily, the evil impulses [within men's hearts] whisper unto those who have made them their own that they should involve you in argument [as to what is and what is not a sin]; and if you pay heed unto them, lo! you will become [like] those who ascribe divinity to other beings or forces beside God.","911":"IS THEN -HE who was dead [in spirit] and whom We thereupon gave life, and for whom We set up a light whereby he might see his way among men - [is then he] like one [who is lost] in darkness deep, out of which he cannot emerge? [But] thus it is: goodly seem all their own doings to those who deny the truth.","912":"And it is in this way that We cause the great ones in every land to become its [greatest] evildoers, there to weave their schemes: yet it is only against themselves that they scheme -and they perceive it not.","913":"And whenever. a [divine] message comes to them, they say, \"We shall not believe unless we are given the like of what God's apostles were given!\" [But] God knows best upon whom to bestow His message. Abasement in the sight of God will befall those who have become guilty of evildoing, and suffering severe for all the schemes which they were wont to weave.","914":"And whomsoever God wills to guide, his bosom He opens wide with willingness towards self-surrender [unto Him]; and whomsoever He wills to let go astray, his bosom He causes to be tight and constricted, as if he were climbing unto the skies: it is thus that God inflicts horror upon those who will not believe.","915":"And undeviating is this thy Sustainer's way. Clearly, indeed, have We spelled out these messages unto people who [are willing to] take them to heart!","916":"Theirs shall be an abode of peace with their Sustainer; and He shall be near unto them in result of what they have been doing.","917":"AND ON THE DAY when He shall gather them [all] together, [He will say:] \"O you who have lived in close communion with [evil] invisible beings! A great many [other] human beings have you ensnared! And those of the humans who were close to them will say: \"O our Sustainer! We did enjoy one another's fellowship [in life]; but (now that] we have reached the end of our term-the term which Thou hast laid down for us - (we see the error of our ways]!\" [But] He will say: \"The fire shall be your abode, therein to abide-unless God wills it otherwise.\" Verily, thy Sustainer is wise, all-knowing.","918":"And in this manner do We cause evildoers to seduce one another by means of their (evil] doings.","919":"[And thus will God continue:] \"O you who have lived in close communion with [evil] invisible beings and [like-minded] humans!

Do not allow Satan to seduce you in the same way as he caused your ancestors to be driven out of the garden: he deprived them of their garment [of God-consciousness] in order to make them aware of their nakedness.

It is they who have led us astray: give, them, therefore, double suffering through fire!\" He, will reply: \"Every one of you deserves double suffering -but you know it not.\"","993":"And the first of them will say unto the last of them: \"So you were in no wise superior to us! Taste, then, this suffering for all [the evil] that you were wont to do!\"","994":"VERILY, unto those who give the lie to Our messages and scorn them in their pride, the gates of heaven shall not be opened; and they shall not enter paradise any more than a twisted rope can pass through a needle's eye: for thus do We requite such as are lost in sin.","995":"Hell will be their resting-place and their covering as well: for thus do We requite the evildoers.","996":"But those who attain to faith and do righteous deeds - [and] We do not burden any human being with more than he is well able to bear - they are destined for paradise, therein to abide,","997":"after We shall have removed whatever unworthy thoughts or feelings may have been [lingering] in their bosoms.

Place us not among the people who have been guilty of evildoing!\"","1002":"And they who [in life] had possessed this faculty of discernment will call out to those whom they recognize by their marks [as sinners], saying: \"What has your amassing [of wealth] availed you, and all the false pride of your past?","1003":"Are those [blessed ones] the self-same people of whom you once solemnly declared, `Never will God bestow His grace upon them'?

Worship God alone: you have no deity other than Him. Verily, I fear lest suffering befall you on an awesome Day!\"","1014":"The great ones among his people replied: \"Verily, we see that thou art obviously lost in error!\"","1015":"Said [Noah]: \"O my people! There is no error in me, but I am an apostle from the Sustainer of all the worlds.","1016":"I am delivering unto you my Sustainer's messages and giving you good advice: for I know [through revelation] from God what you do not know.","1017":"Why, do you deem it strange that a tiding from your Sustainer should have come unto you through a man from among yourselves, so that he might warn you, and that you might become conscious of God, and that you might be graced with His mercy?\"","1018":"And yet they gave him the lie! And so We saved him and those who stood by him, in the ark, the while We caused those who had given the lie to Our messages to drown: verily, they were blind folk!","1019":"AND UNTO [the tribe of] `Ad [We sent] their brother Hud. He said: \"O my people! Worship God alone: you have no deity other than Him. Will you not, then, be conscious of Him?\"","1020":"Said the great ones among his people, who refused to acknowledge the truth: \"Verily, we see that thou art weak-minded; and, verily, we think that thou art a liar!\"","1021":"Said [Hud]: \"O my people! There is no weak-mindedness in me, but I am an apostle from the Sustainer of all the worlds.","1022":"I am delivering unto you my Sustainer's messages and advising you truly and wells.","1023":"Why, do you deem it strange that a tiding from your Sustainer should have come unto you through a man from among yourselves, so that he might warn you? Do but remember how He made you heirs to Noah's people, and endowed you abundantly with power: remember, then, God's blessings, so that you might attain to a happy state!\"","1024":"They answered: \"Hast thou come to us [with the demand] that we worship God alone, and give up all that our forefathers were wont to worship? Bring about, then, that [punishment] with which thou hast threatened us, if thou art a man of truth!\"","1025":"Said [Hud]: \"You are already beset by loath some evils and by your Sustainer's condemnation!

Indeed, I delivered unto you my Sustainer's message and gave you good advice: but you did not love those who gave [you] good advice.\"","1034":"AND [remember] Lot, when he said unto his people: \"Will you commit abominations such as none in all the world has ever done before you?","1035":"Verily, with lust you approach men instead of women: nay, but you are people given to excesses!\"","1036":"But his people's only answer was this: \"Expel them from your land! Verily, they are folk who make themselves out to be pure!”","1037":"Thereupon We saved him and his household except his wife, who was among those that stayed behind","1038":"the while We rained a rain [of destruction] upon the others: and behold what happened in the end to those people lost in sin!","1039":"AND UNTO [the people of] Madyan [We sent] their brother Shu'ayb.

Lay Thou open the truth between us and our people -for Thou art the best of all to lay open the truth!”","1044":"But the great ones among his people, who were bent on denying the truth, said [to his followers]: \"Indeed, if you follow Shu'ayb, you will, verily, be the losers!\"","1045":"Thereupon an earthquake overtook them: and then they lay lifeless, in their very homes, on the ground -","1046":"they who had given the lie to Shu'ayb - as though they had never lived there: they who had given the lie to Shu'ayb -it was they who were the losers!","1047":"And he turned away from them, and said: \"O my people!

[And yet] they took to worshipping it, for they were evildoers:","1103":"although [later,] when they would smite their hands in remorse, having perceived that they had gone astray, they would say, \"Indeed, unless our Sustainer have mercy on us and grant us forgiveness, we shall most certainly be among the lost!\"","1104":"And when Moses returned to his people, full of wrath and sorrow, he exclaimed: \"Vile is the course which you have followed in my absence!

Behold, the people brought me low and almost slew me: so let not mine enemies rejoice at my affliction, and count me not among the evildoing folk!\"","1105":"Said [Moses]: \"O my Sustainer! Grant Thou forgiveness unto me and my brother, and admit us unto Thy grace: for Thou art the most merciful of the merciful!\"","1106":"[And to Aaron he said:] \"Verily, as for those who have taken to worshipping the [golden] - calf - their Sustainer's condemnation will overtake them, and ignominy [will be their lot] in the -life of this world!\" For thus do We requite all who invent [such] falsehood.","1107":"But as for those who do bad deeds and afterwards repent and [truly] believe-verily, after such repentance thy Sustainer is indeed much forgiving, a dispenser of grace!","1108":"And when Moses' wrath as stilled, he took up the tablets, in the writing whereof there was guidance and grace for all who stood in awe of their Sustainer.","1109":"And Moses chose out of his people seventy men to come [and pray for forgiveness] at a time set by Us. Then, when violent trembling seized them, he prayed: \"O my Sustainer! Hadst Thou so willed, Thou wouldst have destroyed them ere this, and me [with them]. Wilt Thou destroy us for what the weak-minded among us have done? (All] this is but a trial from Thee, whereby Thou allowest to go astray whom Thou willest, and guidest aright whom Thou willest. Thou art near unto us: grant us, then, forgiveness and have mercy on us - for Thou art the best of all forgivers!","1110":"And ordain Thou for us what is good in this world as well as in the life to come: behold, unto Thee have we turned in repentance!\" [God] answered: \"With My chastisement do I afflict whom I will - but My grace overspreads everything: and so I shall confer it on those who are conscious of Me and spend in charity, and who believe in Our messages-","1111":"those who shall follow the [last] Apostle, the unlettered Prophet whom they shall find described in the Torah that is with them, and [later on] in the Gospel: [the Prophet] who will enjoin upon them the doing of what is right and forbid them the doing of what is wrong, and make lawful to them the good things of life and forbid them the bad things, and lift from them their burdens and the shackles that were upon them [aforetime].

And when his people asked Moses for water, We inspired him, \"Strike the rock with thy staff!\" -whereupon twelve springs gushed forth from it, so that all the people knew whence to drink., And We caused the clouds to comfort them with their shade, and We sent down unto them manna and quails, [saying:] \"Partake of the good things which We have provided for you as sustenance.\" And [by all their sinning] they did no harm unto Us-but [only] against their own selves did they sin.","1115":"And [remember] when you were told: \"Dwell in this land and eat of its food as you may desire; but say, `Remove Thou from us the burden of our sins,' and enter the gate humbly - [whereupon] We shall forgive you your sins [and] shall amply reward the doers of good.\"","1116":"But those among them who were bent on wrongdoing substituted another saying for that which they had been given: and so We let loose against them a plague from heaven in requital of all their evil doings.","1117":"And ask them about that town which stood by the sea: how its people would profane the Sabbath whenever their fish came to them, breaking the water's surface, on a day on which they ought to have kept Sabbath -because they would not come to them on other than Sabbath-days!

But as for those who have come to believe without having migrated [to your country] - you are in no wise responsible for their protection until such a time as they migrate [to you].

We shall cause them to suffer doubly [in this world]; and then they will be given over to awesome suffering [in the life to come].","1337":"And [there are] others - [people who] have become conscious of their sinning after having done righteous deeds side by side with evil ones; [and] it may well be that God will accept their repentance: for, verily, God is much-forgiving, a dispenser' of grace.","1338":"[Hence, O Prophet,] accept that [part] of their possessions which is offered for the sake of God, so that thou mayest cleanse them thereby and cause them to grow in purity, and pray for them: behold, thy prayer will be [a source of] comfort to them-for God is all-hearing, all-knowing.","1339":"Do they not know that it is God alone who can accept the repentance of His servants and is the [true] recipient of whatever is offered for His sake - and that God alone is an acceptor of repentance, a dispenser of grace?","1340":"And say [unto them, O Prophet]: \"Act! And God will behold your deeds, and [so will] His Apostle, and the believers: and [in the end] you will be brought before Him who knows all that is beyond the reach of a created being's perception as well as all that can be witnessed by a creature's senses or mind -and then He will make you understand what you have been doing.\"","1341":"And [there are yet] others-[people whose cases are] deferred until God wills to judge them: He will either chastise them or turn again unto them in His mercy-for God is all-knowing, wise.","1342":"AND [there are hypocrites] who have established a [separate] house of worship in order to create mischief, and to promote apostasy and disunity among the believers, and to provide an outpost for all who from the outset have been warring against God and His Apostle. And they will surely swear [to you, O believers], \"We had but the best of intentions!\" -the while God [Himself] bears witness that they are lying.","1343":"Never set foot in such a place! Only a house of worship founded, from the very first day, upon God-consciousness is worthy of thy setting foot therein -[a house of worship] wherein there are men desirous of growing in purity: for God loves all who purify themselves.","1344":"Which. then, is the better: he who has founded his building on God-consciousness and [a desire for] His goodly acceptance-or he who has founded his building on the edge of a water-worn, crumbling river-bank, so that it [is bound to] tumble down with him into the fire of hell? For, God does not grace with His guidance people who [deliberately] do wrong:","1345":"the building which they have built will never cease to be a source of deep disquiet in their hearts until their hearts crumble to pieces. And God is all-knowing, wise.","1346":"BEHOLD, God has bought of the believers their lives and their possessions, promising them paradise in return, [and so] they fight in God's cause, and slay, and are slain: a promise which in truth He has willed upon Himself in [the words of] the Torah, and the Gospel, and the Qur'an. And who could be more faithful to his covenant than God? Rejoice, then, in the bargain which you have made with Him: for this, this is the triumph supreme!","1347":"[It is a triumph of] those who turn [unto God] in repentance [whenever they have sinned], and who worship and praise [Him], and go on and on [seeking His goodly acceptance], and bow down [before Him] and prostrate themselves in adoration, and enjoin the doing of what is right and forbid the doing of what is wrong, and keep to the bounds set by God. And give thou [O Prophet] the glad tiding [of God's promise] to all believers.","1348":"IT DOES NOT behove the Prophet and those who have attained to faith to pray that they who ascribed divinity to aught beside God be forgiven [by Him] even though they happened to be [their] near of kin -after it has been made clear unto them that those [dead sinners] are destined for. the blazing fire.","1349":"And Abraham's prayer that his father be forgiven was but due to a promise which he had given the latter [in his lifetime]; but when it was made clear unto him that he had been God's enemy, [Abraham] disavowed him - [although;] behold, Abraham was most tender-hearted. most clement.","1350":"And God would never-after having invited them to His guidance -condemn people for going astray ere He has made [entirely] clear unto them of what they should beware. Verily, God has full knowledge of everything.","1351":"Verily, God's alone is the dominion over the heavens and the earth; He [alone] grants life and deals death; and there is none besides God who could protect you or bring you succour.","1352":"INDEED, God has turned in His mercy unto the Prophet, as well as unto those who have forsaken the domain of evil and those who have sheltered and succoured the Faiths - [all] those who followed him in the hour of distress, when the hearts of some of the other believers had well-nigh swerved from faith. And once again: He has turned unto them in His mercy - for, behold, He is compassionate towards them, a dispenser of grace.","1353":"And [He turned in His mercy, too,] towards the three [groups of believers] who had fallen prey to corruption, until in the end-after the earth, despite all its vastness, had become [too] narrow for them and their souls had become [utterly] constricted they came to know with certainty that there is no refuge from God other than [a return] unto Him; and thereupon He turned again unto them in His mercy, so that they might repent: for, verily, God alone is an acceptor of repentance, a dispenser of grace.","1354":"O YOU who have attained to faith! Remain conscious of God, and be among those who are true to their word!","1355":"It does not behove the people of the [Prophet's] City and the bedouin [who live] around them to hold back from following God's Apostle, or to care for their own selves more than for him -for, whenever they suffer from thirst or weariness or hunger in God's cause, and whenever they take any step which confounds those who deny the truth, and whenever there comes to them from the enemy whatever may be destined for them -[whenever anything thereof comes to pass,,] a good deed is recorded in their favour. Verily, God does not fail to requite the doers of good!","1356":"And whenever they spend anything [for the sake of God], be it little or much, and whenever they move on earth [in God's cause] -it is recorded in their favour, and God will grant them the best reward for all that they have been doing.","1357":"With all this, it is not desirable that all of the believers take the field [in time of war]. From within every group in their midst, some shall refrain from going forth to war, and shall devote themselves [instead] to acquiring a deeper knowledge of the Faith. and [thus be able to] teach their home-coming brethren, so that these [too] might guard themselves against evil.","1358":"O you who have attained to faith! Fight against those deniers of the truth who are near you, and let them find you adamant; and know that. God is with those who are conscious of Him.","1359":"YET WHENEVER a surah [of this divine writ] is bestowed from on high, some of the deniers of the truth are prone to ask, \"Which of you has this [message] strengthened in his faith?\" Now as for those who have attained to faith, it does strengthen them in their faith, and they rejoice in the glad tiding [which God has given them].","1360":"But as for those in whose hearts is disease, each new message but adds another [element of] disbelief to the disbelief which they already harbour, and they die while [still] refusing to acknowledge the truth.","1361":"Are they, then, not aware that they are being tested year-in, year-out? And yet, they do not repent and do not bethink themselves [of God];","1362":"and whenever a surah is bestowed from on high, they look at one another [and say, as it were], \"Is there anyone who can see what is in your hearts?\" -and then they turn away. God has turned their hearts away [from the truth] - for they are people who will not grasp it.","1363":"INDEED, there has come unto you [O mankind] an Apostle from among yourselves: heavily weighs -upon him [the thought] that you might suffer [in the life to come]; full of concern for you [is he, and] full of compassion and mercy towards the believers.","1364":"But if those [who are bent on denying the truth] turn away, say: \"God is enough for me! There is no- deity save Him. In Him have I placed my trust, for He is the Sustainer, in awesome almightiness enthroned.\"","1365":"Alif Lam. Ra. THESE ARE MESSAGES of the divine writ, full of wisdom.","1366":"Do people deem it strange that We should have inspired a man from their own midst [with this Our message]: \"Warn all mankind, and give unto those who have attained to faith the glad tiding that in their Sustainer's sight they surpass all others in that they are completely sincere-? [Only] they who deny the truth say, \"Behold. he is clearly but a spellbinder!\"","1367":"VERILY, your Sustainer is God, who has created the heavens and the earth in six aeons, and is established on the throne of His almightiness, governing all that exists. There is none that could intercede with Him unless He grants leave therefor. Thus is God, your Sustainer: worship, therefore, Him [alone]: will you not, then, keep this in mind?","1368":"Unto Him you all must return: this is, in truth, God's promise-for, behold, He creates [man] in the first instance, and then brings him forth anew to the end that He may reward with equity all who attain to faith and do righteous deeds; whereas for those who are bent on denying the truth there is in store a draught of burning despair and grievous suffering because of their persistent refusal to acknowledge the truth.","1369":"He it is who has made the sun a [source of] radiant light and the moon a light [reflected], and has determined for it phases so that you might know how to compute the years and to measure [time]. None of this has God created without [an inner] truth. Clearly does He spell out these messages unto people of [innate] knowledge:","1370":"for, verily, in the alternating of night and day, and in all that God has created in the heavens and on earth there are messages indeed for people who are conscious of Him!","1371":"Verily, as for those who do not believe that they are destined to meet Us, but content themselves with the life of this world and do not look beyond it, and are heedless of Our messages -","1372":"their goal is the fire in return for all [the evil] that they were wont to do.","1373":"[But,] verily, as for those who have attained to faith and do righteous deeds - their Sustainer guides them aright by means of their faith. [In the life to come,] running waters will flow at their feet in gardens of bliss;","1374":"[and] in that [state of happiness] they will call out, \"Limitless art Thou in Thy glory, O God!\"-and will be answered with the greeting, \"Peace!\" And their call will close with [the words], \"All praise is due to God, the Sustainer of all the worlds!\"","1375":"NOW IF GOD were to hasten for human beings the ill [which they deserve by their sinning] in the same manner as they [themselves] would hasten [the coming to them of what they consider to be] good, their end would indeed come forthwith! But We leave them alone [for a while] -all those who do not believe that they are destined to meet Us: [We leave them alone] in their overweening arrogance, blindly stumbling to and fro.","1376":"For [thus it is:] when affliction befalls man, he cries out unto Us, whether he be lying on his side or sitting or standing; but as soon as We have freed him of his affliction, he goes on as though he had never invoked Us to save him from the affliction that befell him! Thus do their own doings seem goodly unto those who waste their own selves.","1377":"And, indeed, We destroyed before your time [whole] generations when they [persistently] did evil although the apostles sent unto them brought them all evidence of the truth; for they refused to believe [them]. Thus do We requite people who are lost in sin.","1378":"And thereupon We made you their successors on earth, so that We might behold how you act.","1379":"AND [thus it is:] whenever Our messages are conveyed unto them in all their clarity, those who do not believe that they are destined to meet Us [are wont to] say, \"Bring us a discourse other than this, or alter this one.” Say [O Prophet]: \"It is not conceivable that I should alter it of my own volition; I only follow what is revealed to me. Behold, I would dread, were I [thus] to rebel against my Sustainer, the suffering [which would befall me] on that awesome Day [of Judgment]!\"","1380":"Say: \"Had God willed it [otherwise], I would not have conveyed this [divine writ] unto you, nor would He have brought it to your knowledge. Indeed. a whole lifetime have I dwelt among you ere this [revelation came unto me]: will you not, then, use your reason?”","1381":"And who could be more wicked than they who attribute their own lying inventions to God or give the lie to His messages? Verily, those who are lost in sin will never attain to a happy state -","1382":"and [neither will] they [who] worship, side by side with God, things or beings that can neither harm nor benefit them, saying [to themselves], \"These are our intercessors with God!\" Say: \"Do you [think that you could] inform God of anything in the heavens or on earth that He does not know? Limitless is He in His glory, and sublimely exalted above anything to which men may ascribe a share in His divinity!\"","1383":"AND [know that] all mankind were once but one single community, and only later did they begin to hold divergent views. And had it not been for a decree- that had already gone forth from thy Sustainer, all their differences would indeed have been settled [from the outset].","1384":"NOW THEY [who deny the truth] are wont to ask, \"Why has no miraculous sign ever been bestowed upon him from on high by his Sustainer?\" Say, then: \"God's alone is the knowledge of that which. is beyond the reach of human perception.

Thus clearly do We spell out these messages unto people who think!","1389":"AND [know that] God invites [man] unto the abode of peace, and guides him that wills [to be guided] onto a straight way.","1390":"For those who persevere in doing good there is the ultimate good in store, and more [than that]. No darkness and no ignominy will overshadow their faces [on Resurrection Day]: it is they who are destined for paradise, therein to abide.","1391":"But us for those who have done evil deeds - the recompense of an evil, deed shall be the like thereof: and - since they will have none to defend them against God - ignominy will overshadow them as though their faces were veiled by the night's own darkness: it is they who are destined for the fire. therein to abide.","1392":"For, one Day We shall gather them all together, and then We shall say unto those who [in their lifetime] ascribed divinity to aught but God, \"Stand where you are, you and those [beings and powers] to whom you were wont to ascribe a share in God's divinity! -for by then We shall have [visibly] separated them from one another. And the beings to whom they had ascribed a share in God's divinity will say [to those who had worshipped them], \"It was not us that you were wont to worship;","1393":"and none can bear witness between us and you as God does: we were, for certain, unaware of your worshipping [us].","1394":"There and then will every human being clearly apprehend what he has done in the past; and all will be brought back unto God, their true Lord Supreme, and all their false imagery will have forsaken them.","1395":"SAY: \"Who is it that provides you with sustenance out of heaven and earth, or who is it that has full power over [your] hearing and sight?

Be not, then, among the doubters -","1459":"and neither be among those who are bent on giving the lie to God's messages, lest thou find thyself among the lost.","1460":"Verily, they against whom thy Sustainer's word [of judgment] has come true will not attain to faith -","1461":"even though every sign [of the truth] should come within their ken - until they behold the grievous suffering [that awaits them in the life to come].","1462":"For, alas, there has never yet been any community that attained to faith [in its entirety,] and thereupon benefited by its faith, except the people of Jonah. When they came to believe, We removed from them the suffering of disgrace [which otherwise would have befallen them even] in the life of this world, and allowed them to enjoy their life during the time allotted to them.","1463":"And [thus it is:] had thy Sustainer so willed, all those who live on earth would surely have attained to faith, all of them: dost thou, then, think that thou couldst compel people to believe,","1464":"notwithstanding that no human being can ever attain to faith otherwise than by God's leave, and [that] it is He who lays the loathsome evil [of disbelief] upon those who will not use -their reason?","1465":"Say: \"Consider whatever there is in the heavens and on earth!\" But of what avail could all the messages and all the warnings be to people who will not believe?","1466":"Can such, then, expect anything else [to befall them] but the like of the days of [calamity which befell] those [deniers of the truth] who passed away before them? Say: \"Wait, then, [for what will happen) verily, I shall wait with you!\"","1467":"[For thus it always happens: We seal the doom of all who deny the truth and give the lie to Our messages;] and thereupon We save Our apostles and those who have attained to faith. Thus have We willed it upon Ourselves: We save all who believe [in Us],","1468":"SAY [O Prophet]: \"O mankind! If you are in doubt as to what my faith is, then [know that] I do not worship those beings whom you worship beside God, but [that] I worship God alone, who shall cause you [all] to die: for I have been bidden to be among those who believe [in Him alone].\"","1469":"Hence, [O man,] set thy face steadfastly towards the [true] faith, turning away from all that is false, and be not among those who ascribe divinity to aught beside God.","1470":"Thus, do not invoke, side by side with God, anything that can neither benefit thee nor harm thee: for, behold, if thou do it, thou wilt surely be among the evildoers!","1471":"And [know that] if God should touch thee with misfortune, there is none who could remove it save Him; and if He intends good for thee, there is none who could turn away His bounty: He causes it to alight upon whomsoever He wills of His servants. And He alone is truly forgiving, truly a dispenser of grace.","1472":"SAY [O Prophet]: \"O mankind! The truth from your Sustainer has now come unto you. Whoever, therefore, chooses to follow the right path, follows it but for his own good; and whoever chooses to go astray, goes but astray to his own hurt. And I am not responsible for your conduct.\"","1473":"And [as for thyself, O Muhammad,] follow but what is being revealed unto thee, and be patient in adversity, until God shall give His judgment: for He is the best of all judges.","1474":"Alif. Lam. Ra. A DIVINE WRIT [is this], with messages that have been made clear in and by themselves, and have been distinctly spelled out as well - [bestowed upon you] out of the grace of One who is wise, all-aware,","1475":"so that you may worship none but God. [Say, O Prophet:] \"Behold, I come unto you from Him [as] a warner and a bearer of glad tidings:","1476":"Ask your Sustainer to forgive you your sins, and then turn towards Him in repentance - [whereupon] He will grant you a goodly enjoyment of life [in this world] until a term set [by Him is fulfilled]; and [in the life to come] He will bestow upon everyone possessed of merit [a full reward for] his merit. But if you turn away, then, verily, I dread for you the suffering [which is bound to befall you] on that awesome Day","1477":"Unto God you all must return: and He has the power to will anything.\"","1478":"Oh, verily, they [who are bent on denying the truth of this divine writ] are enshrouding their hearts in order to hide from Him. Oh, verily, [even] when they cover themselves with their garments [in order not to see or hear], He knows all that they keep secret as well as all that they bring into the open - for, behold, He has full knowledge of what is in the hearts [of men].","1479":"And there is no living creature on earth but depends for its sustenance on God; and He knows its time-limit [on earth] and its resting-place [after death]: all [this] is laid down in [His] clear decree.","1480":"And He it is who has created the heavens and the earth in six aeons; and [ever since He has willed to create life,] the throne of His almightiness has rested upon water. [God reminds you of your dependence on Him] in order to test you [and thus to make manifest] which of you is best in conduct. For thus it is: if thou sayest [unto men], \"Behold, you shall be raised again after death!\" - they who are bent on denying the truth are sure to answer, \"This is clearly nothing but an enchanting delusion\"","1481":"And thus it is: if We defer their suffering until a time-limit set [by Us], they are sure to say, \"What is preventing it [from coming now]?\" Oh, verily, on the Day when it befalls them there will be nothing to avert it from them; and they shall be overwhelmed by the very thing which they were wont to deride.","1482":"And thus it is: if We let man taste some of Our grace, and then take it away from him -behold, he abandons all hope, forgetting all gratitude [for Our past favours].","1483":"And thus it is: if We let him taste ease and plenty after hardship has visited him, he is sure to say, \"Gone is all affliction from me!\"-for, behold, he is given to vain exultation, and glories only in himself.","1484":"[And thus it is with most men-] save those who are patient in adversity and do righteous deeds: it is they whom forgiveness of sins awaits, and a great reward.","1485":"IS IT, then, conceivable [O Prophet] that thou couldst omit any part of what is being revealed unto thee [because the deniers of the truth dislike it,-and] because thy heart is distressed at their saying, \"Why has not a treasure been bestowed upon him from on high?\" -or, \"[Why has not] an angel come [visibly:: with him?\" [They fail to understand that] thou art only a warner, whereas God has everything in His care;","1486":"and so they assert, \"[Muhammad himself] has invented this [Qur'an)!\" Say [unto them]: \"Produce, then, ten surahs of similar merit, invented [by yourselves], and [to this end] call to your aid whomever you can, other than, God, if what you say is true!","1487":"And if they [whom you have called to your aid] are not able to help you, then know that [this Qur'an] has been bestowed from on high out of God's wisdom alone, and that there is no deity save Him. Will you, then, surrender yourselves unto Him?\"","1488":"AS FOR THOSE who care for [no more than] the life of this world and its bounties -We shall repay them in full for all that they did in this [life], and they, shall not be deprived of their just due therein:","1489":"[yet] it is they who, in the life to come, shall have nothing but the fire -for in vain shall be all that they wrought in this [world], and worthless all that they ever did!","1490":"Can, then, [he who cares for no more than the life of this world be compared with] one who takes his stand on a clear evidence from his Sustainer, conveyed through [this] testimony from Him, as was the revelation vouchsafed to Moses aforetime-[a divine writ ordained by Him] to be a guidance and grace [unto man]? They [who understand this message-it is they alone who truly] believe in it; whereas for any of those who, leagued together [in common hostility], deny its truth - the fire shall be their appointed state [in the life to come]. And so, be not in doubt about this [revelation]: behold, it is the truth from thy Sustainer, even though most people will not believe in it.","1491":"And who could be more wicked than they who attribute their own lying inventions to God? [On the Day of Judgment, such as] these shall be arraigned before their Sustainer, and those who are called upon to bear witness [against them] shall say, \"It is they who uttered lies about their Sustainer!\" Oh, verily, God's rejection is the due of all evildoers","1492":"who turn others away from the path of God and try to make it appear crooked -since it is they, they who refuse to acknowledge the truth of the life to come!","1493":"Never can they elude [their final reckoning, even if they remain unscathed] on earth: never will they find anyone who could protect them from God. [In the life to come] double suffering will be imposed on them for having lost the ability to hear [the truth] and having failed to see [it].","1494":"It is they who have squandered their own selves-for [on the Day of Resurrection] all their false imagery will have forsaken them:","1495":"truly it is they, they who in the life to come shall be the losers!","1496":"Behold, [only] those who attain to faith and do righteous deeds and humble themselves before their Sustainer - [only] they are destined for paradise, and there shall they abide.","1497":"These two kinds of man may be likened to the blind and deaf and the seeing and hearing. Can these two be deemed alike in [their] nature? ` Will you not, then, keep this in mind?","1498":"AND INDEED, [it was with the same message that] We sent forth Noah unto his people: \"Behold, I come unto you with the plain warning","1499":"that you may worship none but God-for, verily, I fear lest suffering befall you on a grievous Day!\"","1500":"But the great ones among his people, who refused to acknowledge the truth, answered: \"We do not see in thee anything but a mortal man like ourselves; and we do not see that any follow thee save those who are quite obviously the most abject among us; and we do not see that you could be in any way superior to us: on the contrary, we think that you are liars!\"","1501":"Said [Noah]: \"O my people! What do you think? If [it be true that I am taking my stand on a clear evidence from my~ Sustainer, who has vouchsafed unto me grace from Himself - [a revelation] to which you have remained blind-: [if this be true,] can we force it on you even though it be hateful to you?","1502":"\"And, O my people, no benefit do I ask of you for this [message]: my reward rests with none but God. And I shall not repulse [any of] those who have attained to faith. Verily, they [know that they] are destined to meet their Sustainer, whereas in you I see people without any awareness [of right and wrong]!","1503":"And, O my people, who would shield me from God were I to repulse them? Will you not, then, keep this in mind?","1504":"\"And I do not say unto you, `God's treasures are with me'; nor [do I say], `I know the reality which is beyond the reach of human perception'; nor do I say, 'Behold, I am an angel'; nor do I say of those whom your eyes hold in contempt, `Never will God grant them any good'- for God is fully aware of what is in their hearts. [Were I to speak thus,] verily, I would indeed be among the evildoers.\"","1505":"[But the great ones] said: \"O Noah! Thou hast contended with us in argument, and hast [needlessly] prolonged our controversy: bring upon us, therefore, that with which thou dost threaten us, if thou art a man of truth!\"","1506":"He answered: \"Only God can bring it upon you, if He so wills, and you shall not elude it:","1507":"for, my advice will not benefit you -much as I desire to give you good advice - if it be God's will that you shall remain lost in grievous error. He is your Sustainer, and unto Him you must return.\"","1508":"DO SOME, perchance, assert, \"[Muhammad] has invented this [story]\"? Say [O Prophet]: \"If I have invented it, upon me be this sin; but far be it from me to commit the sin of which you are guilty.\"","1509":"AND THIS was revealed unto Noah: \"Never will any of thy people believe except those who have already attained to faith. Be not, then, distressed by anything that they may do,","1510":"but build, under Our eyes and according to Our inspiration, the ark [that shall save thee and those who follow thee]; and do not appeal to Me in behalf of those who are bent on evildoing for, behold, they are destined to be drowned!\"","1511":"And [so Noah] set himself to building the ark; and every time the great ones of his people passed by him, they scoffed at him. [Thereupon] he said: \"If you are scoffing at us-behold, we are scoffing at you [and your ignorance], just as you are scoffing at us.","1512":"But in time you will come to know who it is that [in this world] shall be visited by suffering which will cover him with ignominy, and upon whom long lasting suffering shall alight [in the life to come]!\"","1513":"[And so it went on] till, when Our judgment came to pass, and waters gushed forth in torrents over the face of the earth, We said [unto Noah]: \"Place on board of this [ark] one pair of each [kind of animal] of either sex, as well as thy family -except those on whom [Our] sentence has already been passed -and all [others] who have attained to faith!\"-for, only a few [of Noah's people] shared his faith.","1514":"So he said [unto his followers]: \"Embark in this [ship]! In the name of God be its run and its riding at anchor! Behold, my. Sustainer is indeed much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace!\"","1515":"And it moved on with them into waves that were like mountains. At that [moment] Noah cried out to a son of his, who had kept himself aloof [from the others]: \"O my dear son! Embark with us, and remain not with those who deny the truth!\"","1516":"[But the son] answered: \"I shall betake myself to a mountain that will protect me from the waters.\" Said [Noah]: \"Today there is no protection [for anyone] from God's judgment, save [for] those who have earned [His] mercy!\" And a wave rose up between them, and [the son] was among those who were drowned.","1517":"And the word was spoken: \"O earth, swallow up thy waters! And, O sky, cease [thy rain]!\" And the waters sank into the earth, and the will [of God] was done, and the ark came to rest on Mount Judl And the word was spoken: \"Away with these evildoing folk!\"","1518":"And Noah called out to his Sustainer, and said: \"O my Sustainer! Verily, my son was of my family; and, verily, Thy promise always comes true, and Thou art the most just of all judges!\"","1519":"[God] answered: \"O Noah, behold, he was not of thy family, for, verily, he was unrighteous in his conduct. And thou shalt not ask of Me anything whereof thou canst not have any knowledge: thus, behold, do I admonish thee lest thou become one of those who are unaware [of what is right].\"","1520":"Said [Noah]: \"O my Sustainer! Verily, I seek refuge with Thee from [ever again] asking of Thee anything whereof I cannot have any knowledge! For unless Thou grant me forgiveness and bestow Thy mercy upon me, I shall be among the lost!\"","1521":"[Thereupon] the word was spoken: \"O Noah! Disembark in peace from Us, and with [Our] blessings upon thee as well as upon the people [who are with thee, and the righteous ones that will spring from thee and] from those who are with thee. But [as for the unrighteous] folk [that will spring from you] - We shall allow them to enjoy life [for a little while], and then there will befall them grievous suffering from Us.\"","1522":"THESE ACCOUNTS of something that was beyond the reach of thy perception We [now] reveal unto thee, [O Muhammad: for] neither thou nor thy people knew them [fully] ere this. Be, then, [like Noah,] patient in adversity - for, behold, the future belongs to the God-conscious!","1523":"AND UNTO [the tribe of] `Ad [We sent] their brother Hud. He said: \"O my people! Worship God [alone]: you have no deity other than Him. [As it is,] you are but inventors of falsehood!","1524":"\"O my people! No reward do I ask of you for this [message]: my reward rests with none but Him who brought me into being. Will you not, then, use your reason?","1525":"\"Hence, O my people, ask your Sustainer to forgive you your sins, and then turn towards Him in repentance-[whereupon] He will shower upon you heavenly blessings abundant, and will add strength to your strength: only do not turn away [from me] as people lost in sin!\"","1526":"Said they: \"O Hud! Thou hast brought us no clear evidence [that thou art a prophet]; and we are not going to forsake our gods on thy mere word, the more so as we do not believe thee.","1527":"We can say no more than that one of our gods may have smitten thee with something evil!\" Answered [Hud]: \"Behold, I call God to witness - and you, too, be [my] witnesses - that, verily, it is not in me to ascribe divinity, as you do, to aught","1528":"beside Him! Contrive, then, [anything that you may wish] against me, all of you, and give me no respite!","1529":"Behold, I have placed my trust in God, [who is] my Sustainer as well as your Sustainer: for there is no living creature which He does not hold by its forelock. Verily, straight is my Sustainer's way!","1530":"\"But if you choose to turn away, then [know that] I have delivered to you the message with which I was sent unto you, and [that] my Sustainer may cause another people to take your place, whereas you will in no wise harm Him. Verily, my Sustainer watches over all things!\"","1531":"And so, when Our judgment came to pass, by Our grace We saved Hud and those who shared his faith; and We saved them [too] from suffering severe [in the life to come].","1532":"And that was [the end of the tribe of] `Ad, [who] had rejected their Sustainer's messages, and rebelled against His apostles, and followed the bidding of every arrogant enemy of the truth.","1533":"And they were pursued in this world by [God's] rejection, and [shall finally be overtaken by it] on the Day of Resurrection. Oh, verily, [the tribe of] `Ad denied their Sustainer! Oh, away with the `Ad, the people of Hud!","1534":"AND UNTO [the tribe of] Thamud [We sent] their brother Salih. He said: \"O my people! Worship God [alone]: you have no deity other than Him. He brought you into being out of the earth, and made you thrive thereon. Ask Him, therefore, to forgive you your sins, and then turn towards Him in repentance-for, verily, my Sustainer is ever-near, responding [to the call of whoever calls unto Him]!\"","1535":"They answered: \"O Salih! Great hopes did we place in thee ere this! Wouldst thou forbid us to worship what our forefathers were wont to worship? Because [of this], behold, we are in grave doubt, amounting to suspicion, about [the meaning of] thy call to us!\"","1536":"He retorted: \"O my people! What do you think? If [it be true that] I am taking my stand on a cleat evidence from my Sustainer, who has vouchsafed unto me grace from Himself -[if this be true,] who would shield me from God were I to rebel against Him? Hence, what you are offering me is no more than perdition!\"","1537":"And [then he said]: \"O my people! This she-camel belonging to God shall be a token for you: so leave her alone to pasture on God's earth, and do her no harm, lest speedy chastisement befall you!\"","1538":"But they cruelly slaughtered her. And thereupon [Salih] said: \"[Only] for three days [more] shall you enjoy life in your homes: this is a judgment which will not be belied!\"","1539":"And so, when Our judgment came to pass, by Our grace We saved Salih and those who shared his faith; and [We saved them, too,] from the ignominy of [Our rejection on] that Day [of Resurrection]. Verily, thy Sustainer alone is powerful, almighty!","1540":"And the blast [of God's punishment] overtook those who had been bent on evildoing: and then they lay lifeless, in their very homes, on the ground,","1541":"as though they had never lived there. Oh, verily, [the tribe of] Thamud denied their Sustainer! Oh, away with the Thamud!","1542":"AND, INDEED, there came unto Abraham Our [heavenly] messengers, bearing a glad tiding. They bade him peace; [and] he answered, \"[And upon you be] peace!\"-and made haste to place before them a roasted calf.","1543":"But when he saw that their hands did not reach out towards it, he deemed their conduct strange and became apprehensive of them. [But] they said: \"Fear not! Behold, we are sent to the people of Lot.","1544":"And his wife, standing [nearby], laughed [with happiness]; whereupon We gave her the glad tiding of [the birth of] Isaac and, after Isaac, of [his son] Jacob.","1545":"Said she: \"Oh, woe is me! Shall I bear a child, now that I am an old woman and this husband of mine is an old man? Verily, that would be a strange thing indeed!\"","1546":"Answered [the messengers]: \"Dost thou deem it strange that God should decree what He wills? The grace of God and His blessings be upon you, O people of this house! Verily, ever to be praised, sublime is He!\"","1547":"And when the fear had left Abraham, and the glad tiding had been conveyed to him, he began to plead with Us for Lot's people:","1548":"for, behold, Abraham was most clement, most tender-hearted, intent upon turning to God again and again.","1549":"[But God's messengers replied:] \"O Abraham! Desist from this [pleading]! Behold, thy Sustainer's judgment has already gone forth: and, verily, there shall fall upon them a chastisement which none can avert!\"","1550":"AND WHEN Our messengers came unto Lot, he was sorely grieved on their account, seeing that it was beyond his power to shield them; and he exclaimed: \"This is a woeful day!\"","1551":"And his people came running to him, impelled towards his house [by their desire]: for they had ever been wont to commit [such], abominations. Said [Lot]: \"O my people! [Take instead] these daughters of mine: they are purer for you [than men]! Be, then, conscious of God, and disgrace me not by [assaulting] my guests. Is there not among you even one right-minded man?\"","1552":"They answered: \"Thou hast always known that we have no use whatever for thy daughters; and, verily, well dost thou know what we want!\"","1553":"Exclaimed [Lot]: \"Would that I had the strength to defeat you, or that I could lean upon some mightier support!\"","1554":"[Whereupon the angels] said: \"O Lot! Behold, we are messengers from thy Sustainer! Never shall [thy enemies] attain to thee!

Verily, their appointed time is the morning [and] is not the morning nigh?\"","1555":"And so, when Our judgment came to pass, We turned those [sinful towns] upside down, and rained down upon them stone-hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained. one upon another,","1556":"marked out in thy Sustainer's sight [for the punishment of such as are lost in sin].

Oh, away with [the people of] Madyan, even as the Thamud have been done away with!","1569":"AND, INDEED, We sent Moses with Our messages and a manifest authority [from Us]","1570":"unto Pharaoh and his great ones: but these followed [only] Pharaoh's bidding - and Pharaoh's bidding led by no means to what is right.","1571":"[And so] he shall go before his people on the Day of Resurrection, having led them [in this world] towards the fire [of the life to come]; and vile was the destination towards which they were led -","1572":"seeing that they were pursued by [God's] rejection in this [world], and [shall be finally overtaken by it] on the Day of Resurrection; [and] vile was the gift which they were given!","1573":"THIS ACCOUNT of the [fate of those ancient] communities - some of them still remaining, and some [extinct like] a field mown-down - We convey unto thee [as a lesson for mankind]:","1574":"for, no wrong did We do to them, but it was they who wronged themselves. And when thy Sustainer's judgment came to pass, those deities of theirs which they had been wont to invoke instead of God proved of no avail whatever to them, and brought them no more than utter perdition.","1575":"And such is thy Sustainer's punishing grasp whenever He takes to task any community that is given to evildoing: verily, His punishing grasp is grievous, severe!","1576":"Herein, behold, lies a message indeed for all who fear the suffering [which may befall them] in the life to come, (and are conscious of the coming of] that Day on which all mankind shall be gathered together-that Day [of Judgment] which shall be witnessed [by all that ever lived],","1577":"and which We shall not delay beyond a term set [by Us].","1578":"When that Day comes, not a soul will speak. unless it be by His leave; and of those [that are gathered together], some will be wretched and some, happy.","1579":"Now as for those who [by their deeds] will have brought wretchedness upon them-selves, [they shall live] in the fire, where they will have [nothing but] moans and sobs [to relieve their pain],","1580":"therein to abide as long as the heavens and the earth endure-unless thy Sustainer wills it otherwise: for, verily, thy Sustainer is a sovereign doer of whatever He wills.","1581":"But as for those who [by virtue of their past deeds] will have been blest with happiness, [they shall live] in paradise, therein to abide as long as the heavens and the earth endure -unless thy Sustainer wills it otherwise -as a gift unceasing.","1582":"AND SO, [O Prophet,] be not in doubt about anything that those [misguided people] worship: they but [thoughtlessly] worship as their forefathers worshipped aforetime; and, behold, We shall most certainly give them their full due [for whatever good or evil they have earned], without diminishing aught thereof.","1583":"And, indeed, [similar was the case when] We vouchsafed the divine writ unto Moses, and some of his people set their own views against it; and had it not been for a decree that had already gone forth from thy Sustainer, judgment would indeed have been passed on them [then and there]: for, behold, they were in grave doubt, amounting to suspicion, about him [who called them unto God].","1584":"And, verily, unto each and all will thy Sustainer give their full due for whatever [good or evil] they may have done: behold, He is aware of all that they do!","1585":"Pursue, then, the right course, as thou hast been bidden [by God], together with all who, with thee, have turned unto Him; and let none of you behave in an overweening manner: for, verily, He sees all that you do.","1586":"And do not incline towards, nor rely upon, those who are bent on evildoing lest the fire [of the hereafter] touch you: for [then] you would have none to protect you from God, nor would you ever be succoured [by Him].","1587":"And be constant in praying at the beginning and the end of the day, as well as during the early watches of the night: for, verily, good deeds drive away evil deeds: this is a reminder to all who bear [God] in mind.","1588":"And be patient in adversity: for, verily,. God does not fail to requite the doers of good!","1589":"BUT, ALAS, among those generations [whom We destroyed] before your time there were no people endowed with any virtue - [people] who would speak out against the [spread of] corruption on earth -except the few of them whom We saved [because of their righteousness], whereas those who were bent on evildoing only pursued pleasures which corrupted their whole being, and so lost themselves in sinning.","1590":"For, never would thy Sustainer destroy a community for wrong [beliefs alone] so long as its people behave righteously [towards one another].","1591":"And had thy Sustainer so willed, He could surely have made all mankind one single community: but [He willed it otherwise, and so] they continue to hold divergent views'","1592":"[all of them,] save those upon whom thy Sustainer has bestowed His grace.

Behold, I saw [in a dream] eleven stars, as well as the sun and the moon: I saw them prostrate themselves before me!\"","1601":"[Jacob] replied: \"O my dear son! Do not relate thy dream to thy brothers lest [out of envy] they devise an evil scheme against thee; verily, Satan is man's open foe!","1602":"For, [as thou hast been shown in thy dream,] even thus will thy Sustainer elect thee, and will impart unto thee some understanding of the inner meaning of happenings, and will bestow the full measure of His blessings upon thee and upon the House of Jacob -even as, aforetime, He bestowed it in full measure upon thy forefathers Abraham and Isaac. Verily, thy Sustainer is all-knowing, wise!\"","1603":"Indeed, in [the story of] Joseph and his brothers there are messages for all who search [after truth].","1604":"NOW [Joseph's brothers] spoke [thus to one another:] \"Truly, Joseph and his brother [Benjamin] are dearer to our father than we, even though we are so many. Behold, our father is surely suffering from an aberration!\"","1605":"[Said one of them:] \"Slay Joseph, or else drive him away to some [faraway] land, so that your father's regard may be for you alone: and after this is done, you will be [free to repent and to live once again as] righteous people!\"","1606":"Another of them said: \"Do not slay Joseph, but -rather - if you must do something - cast him into the dark depths of this well, [whence] some caravan may pick him up.\"","1607":"[On this they agreed; and thereupon] they spoke [thus to their father]: \"O our father! Wherefore wilt thou not trust us with Joseph, seeing that we are indeed his well-wishers?","1608":"Let him go out with us tomorrow, that he may enjoy himself and play: and, verily, we shall guard him well!\"","1609":"[Jacob] answered: \"Behold, it grieves me indeed [to think] that you might take him with you, for I dread lest the wolf devour him at a moment when you are heedless of him!\"","1610":"Said they: \"Surely, if the wolf were to devour him notwithstanding that we are so many-then, behold, we ought ourselves to perish!\"","1611":"And so, when they went away with him, they decided to cast him into the dark depths of the well. And We revealed [this] unto him: \"Thou wilt yet remind them of this their deed at a time when they shall not perceive [who thou art]!\"","1612":"And at nightfall they came to their father, weeping,","1613":"[and] said: \"O our father! Behold, we went off racing with one another, and left Joseph behind with our things; and thereupon the wolf devoured him! But [we know that] thou wouldst not believe us even though we speak the truth\" -","1614":"and they produced his tunic with false blood upon it. [But Jacob] exclaimed: \"Nay, but it is your [own] minds that have made [so terrible] a happening seem a matter of little account to you! But [as for myself,] patience in adversity is most goodly [in the sight of God]; and it is to God [alone] that I pray to give me strength to bear the misfortune which you have described to me.\"","1615":"AND THERE CAME a caravan; and they sent forth their drawer of water, and he let down his bucket into the well - [and when he saw Joseph] he exclaimed: \"Oh, what a lucky find, this boy!\" And they hid him with a view to selling him: but God had full knowledge of all that they were doing.","1616":"And they sold him for a paltry price - a mere few silver coins: thus low did they value him.","1617":"And the man from Egypt who bought him said to his wife: \"Make his stay [with us] honourable; he may well be of use to us, or we may adopt him as a son. And thus We gave unto Joseph a firm place on earth; and [We did this] so that We might impart unto him some understanding of the inner meaning of happenings. For, God always prevails in whatever be His purpose: but most people know it not.","1618":"And when he reached full manhood, We bestowed upon him the ability to judge [between right and wrong], as well as [innate] knowledge: for thus do We reward the doers of good.","1619":"And [it so happened that] she in whose house he was living [conceived a passion for him and] sought to make him yield himself unto her; and she bolted the doors and said, \"Come thou unto me!\" [But Joseph] answered: \"May God preserve me! Behold, goodly has my master made my stay [in this house]! Verily, to no good end come they that do [such] wrong!\"","1620":"And, indeed, she desired him, and he desired her; [and he would have succumbed] had he not seen [in this temptation] an evidence of his Sustainer's truth: thus [We willed it to be] in order that We might avert from him all evil and all deeds of abomination -for, behold, he was truly one of Our servants.","1621":"And they both rushed to the door; and she [grasped and] rent his tunic from behind-and [lo!] they met her lord at the door! Said she: \"What ought to be the punishment of one who had evil designs on [the virtue of] thy wife - [what] but imprisonment or a [yet more] grievous chastisement?\"","1622":"[Joseph] exclaimed: \"It was she who sought to make me yield myself unto her!\" Now one of those present, a member of her own household, suggested this: If his tunic has been torn from the front, then she is telling the truth, and he is a liar;","1623":"but if his tunic has been torn from behind, then she is lying, and he is speaking the truth.\"","1624":"And when (her husband] saw that his tunic was torn from behind, he said: \"Behold, this is [an instance] of your guile, O womankind! Verily, awesome is your guile!","1625":"[But,] Joseph, let this pass! And thou, [O wife,] ask forgiveness for thy sin-for, verily, thou hast been greatly at fault!\"","1626":"NOW the women of the city spoke [thus to one another]: \"The wife of this nobleman is trying to induce her slave-boy to yield himself unto her! Her love for him has pierced her heart; verily, we see that she is undoubtedly suffering from an aberration!","1627":"Thereupon, when she heard of their malicious talk, she sent for them, and prepared for them a sumptuous repast, and handed each of them a knife and said [to Joseph]: \"Come out and show thyself to them!\" And when the women saw him, they were greatly amazed at his beauty, and [so flustered were they that] they cut their hands [with their knives], exclaiming, \"God save us! This is no mortal man! This is nought but a noble angel!\"","1628":"Said she: \"This, then, is he about whom you have been blaming me! And, indeed, I did try to make him yield himself unto me, but he remained chaste. Now, however, if he does not do what I bid him, he shall most certainly be imprisoned, and shall most certainly find himself among the despised!","1629":"Said he: \"O my Sustainer! Prison is more desirable to me than [compliance with] what these women invite me to: for, unless Thou turn away their guile from me, I might yet yield to their allure and become one of those who are unaware [of right and wrong].\"","1630":"And his Sustainer responded to his prayer, and freed him from the threat of their guile: verily, He alone is all-hearing, all-knowing.","1631":"For, presently it occurred to the nobleman and his household _ [even] after they had seen all the signs [of Joseph's innocence] - that they might as well imprison him for a time.","1632":"NOW two young men happened to go to prison at the same time as Joseph. One of them said: \"Behold, I saw myself [in a dream] pressing wine.\" And the other said: \"Behold, I saw myself [in a dream] carrying bread on my head, and birds were eating thereof.\" [And both entreated Joseph:] \"Let us know the real meaning of this! Verily, we see that thou art one of those who know well [how to interpret dreams].","1633":"[Joseph] answered: \"Ere there comes unto you the meal which you are [daily] fed, I shall have informed you of the real meaning of your dreams, [so that you might know what is to come] before it comes unto you: for this is [part] of the knowledge which my Sustainer has imparted to me. \"Behold, I have left behind me the ways of people who do not believe in God, and who persistently refuse to acknowledge the truth of the life to come;","1634":"and I follow the creed of my forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. It is not conceivable that we should [be allowed to] ascribe divinity to aught beside God: this is [an outcome] of God's bounty unto us and unto all mankind -but most people are ungrateful.","1635":"\"O my companions in imprisonment! Which is more reasonable: [belief in the existence of numerous divine] lords, each of them different from the other\" -or [in] the One God, who holds absolute sway over all that exists?","1636":"\"All that you worship instead of God is nothing but [empty] names which you have invented - you and your forefathers- [and] for which God has bestowed no warrant from on high. Judgment [as to what is right and what is wrong] rests with God alone-[and] He has ordained that you should worship nought but Him: this is the [one] ever-true faith; but most people know it not","1637":"\"[And now,] O my companions in imprisonment, [I shall tell you the meaning of your dreams:] as for one of you two, he will [again] give his lord [the King] wine to drink; but as for the other, he will be crucified, and birds will eat off his head. [But whatever be your future,] the matter on which you have asked me to enlighten you has been decided [by God].\"","1638":"And [thereupon Joseph] said unto the one of the two whom he considered saved: \"Mention me unto thy lord [when thou art free]!\" But Satan caused him to forget to mention [Joseph] to his lord, and so he remained in prison a few [more] years.","1639":"AND [one day] the King said: Behold, I saw [in a dream] seven fat cows being devoured by seven emaciated ones, and seven green ears [of wheat] next to [seven] others that were withered. O you nobles! Enlighten me about [the meaning of] my dream, if you are able to interpret dreams!\"","1640":"They answered: \" [This is one of] the most involved and confusing of dreams, and we have no deep knowledge of the real meaning of dreams.\"","1641":"At that, the one of the two [erstwhile prisoners] who had been saved, and [who suddenly] remembered [Joseph] after all that time, spoke [thus]: \"It is I who can inform you of the real meaning of this [dream]; so let me go [in search of it].\"","1642":"[And he went to see Joseph in the prison and said to him:] \"Joseph, O thou truthful one! Enlighten us about [the meaning of a dream in which] seven fat cows were being devoured by seven emaciated ones, and seven green ears [of wheat appeared] next to [seven] others that were withered - so that I may return [with thy explanation] unto the people [of the court, and] that they may come to know [what manner of man thou art]!\"","1643":"[Joseph] replied: \"You shall sow for seven years as usual; but let all [the grain] that you harvest remain [untouched] in its ear, excepting only a little, whereof you may eat:","1644":"for, after that [period of seven good years] there will come seven hard [years] which will devour all that you shall have laid up for them, excepting only a little of that which you shall have kept in store.","1645":"And after that there will come a year in which the people will be delivered from all distress, and in which they will press [oil and wine as before].\"","1646":"And [as soon as Joseph's interpretation. was conveyed to him,] the King said: \"Bring him before me!\" But when the [King's] messenger came unto him, [Joseph] said: \"Go back to thy lord and ask him [first to find out the truth] about those women who cut their hands-for, behold, [until now it is] my Sustainer [alone who] has full knowledge of their guile!\"","1647":"[Thereupon the King sent for those women; and when they came,] he asked: \"What was it that you hoped to achieve when you sought to make Joseph yield himself unto you?\" The women answered: \"God save us! We did not perceive the least evil [intention] on his part!\" [And] the wife of Joseph's former master exclaimed: \"Now has the truth come to light! It was I who sought to make him yield himself unto me - whereas he, behold, was indeed speaking the truth!\"","1648":"[When Joseph learned what had happened, he said: \"I asked for] this, so that [my former master] might know that I did not betray him behind his back, and that God does not bless with His guidance the artful schemes of those who betray their trust.","1649":"And yet, I am not trying to absolve myself: for, verily, man's inner self does incite [him] to evil, and saved are only they upon whom my Sustainer bestows His grace. Behold, my Sustainer is much forgiving, a dispenser of grace!\"","1650":"And the King said: \"Bring him unto me, so that I may attach him to my own person.\" And when he had spoken with him, [the King] said: \"Behold, [from] this day thou shalt be of high standing with us, invested with all trust!\"","1651":"[Joseph] replied: \"Place in my charge the store-houses of the land; behold, I shall be a good and knowing keeper.","1652":"And thus We established Joseph securely in the land [of Egypt]: he had full mastery over it, [doing] whatever he willed. [Thus do] We cause Our grace to alight upon whomever We will; and We do not fail to requite the doers of good.","1653":"But in the eyes of those who have attained to faith and have always been conscious of Us, a reward in the life to come is a far greater good [than any reward in this world].","1654":"AND [after some years,] Joseph's brothers came [to Egypt] and presented themselves before him: and he knew them [at once], whereas they did not recognize him.","1655":"And when he had provided them with their provisions, he said: \"[When you come here next,] bring unto me that brother of yours from your father's side. Do you not see that I have given [you] full measure and have been the best of hosts?","1656":"But if you do not bring him unto me, you shall never again receive a single measure [of grain] from me, nor shall you [be allowed to] come near me!\"","1657":"They answered: \"We shall try to persuade his father to part with him, and, verily, we shall do [our utmost]!\"","1658":"And [Joseph] said to his servants: \"Place their merchandise in their camel-packs, so that they may find it there when they come home, and hence be the more eager to return.","1659":"And so, when they returned to their father, [Joseph's brothers] said: \"O our father! All grain is [to be] withheld from us [in the future unless we bring Benjamin with us]: send, therefore, our brother with us, so that we may obtain our measure (of grain]; and, verily, we shall guard him well!\"","1660":"[Jacob] replied: \"Shall I trust you with him in the same way as I trusted you with his brother (Joseph] aforetime? [Nay,] but God's guardianship is better [than yours], for He is the most merciful of the merciful!\"","1661":"Thereupon, when they opened their packs, they discovered that their merchandise had been returned to them; [and] they said: \"O our father! What more could we desire? Here is our merchandise: it has been returned to us! [If thou send Benjamin with us,] we shall (again] be able to bring food for our family, and shall guard our brother [well], and receive in addition another camel-load of grain That [which we have brought the first time] was but a scanty measure.\"","1662":"Said [Jacob]: \"I will not send him with you until you give me a solemn pledge, before God, that you will indeed bring him back unto me, unless you yourselves be encompassed [by death]!\" And when they had given him their solemn pledge, [Jacob] said: \"God is witness to all that we say!\"","1663":"And he added: \"O my sons! Do not enter [the city all] by one gate, but enter by different gates. Yet [even so,] I can be of no avail whatever to you against [anything that may be willed by] God: judgment [as to what is to happen] rests with none but God. In Him have I placed my trust: for, all who have trust [in His existence] must place their trust in Him alone.\"","1664":"But although they entered [Joseph's city] in the way their father had bidden them, this proved of no avail whatever to them against [the plan of] God [His request] had served only to satisfy Jacob's heartfelt desire [to protect them]: for, behold, thanks to what We had imparted unto him, he was indeed endowed with the knowledge [that God's will must always prevail]; but most people know it not.","1665":"AND WHEN [the sons of Jacob] presented themselves before Joseph, he drew his brother [Benjamin] unto himself, saying [to him in secret]: \"Behold, I am thy brother! So grieve thou not over their past doings!\"","1666":"And [later,] when he had provided them with their provisions, he placed the [King's] drinking-cup in his brother's camel-pack. And [as they were leaving the city,] a herald called out: \"O you people of the caravan! Verily, you are thieves!","1667":"Turning towards the herald and his companions, the brothers asked: \"What is it that you miss?\"","1668":"They answered: \"We miss the King's goblet; and he who produces it shall receive a camel-load [of grain as reward]!\" And [the herald added:] \"I pledge myself to this _ [promise]!\"","1669":"Said [the brothers]: \"By God! Well do you know that we have not come to commit deeds of corruption in this land, and that we have not been thieving!\"","1670":"[The Egyptians] said: \"But what shall be the requital of this [deed] if you are [proved to be] liars?\"","1671":"[The brothers] replied: \"Its requital? He in whose camel-pack [the cup] is found-he shall be [enslaved as] a requital thereof! Thus do we [ourselves] requite the doers of [such] wrong.","1672":"Thereupon [they were brought before Joseph to be searched; and] he began with the bags of his half-brothers before the bag of his brother [Benjamin]: and in the end he brought forth the drinking Cups out of his brother's bag. In this way did We contrive for Joseph [the attainment of his heart's desire]: under the King's law, he would [otherwise] not have been able to detain his brother, had not God so willed. We do raise to [high] degrees [of knowledge] whomever We will - but above everyone who is endowed with knowledge there is One who knows all.","1673":"[As soon as the cup came to light out of Benjamin's bag, the brothers] exclaimed: \"If he has stolen-well, a brother of his used to steal afore-time!\" Thereupon Joseph said to himself, without revealing his thought to them: \"You are far worse in this respect, and God is fully aware of what you are saying.","1674":"They said: \"O thou great one! Behold, he has a father, a very old man: detain, therefore, one of us in his stead. Verily, we see that thou art a doer of good!\"","1675":"He answered: \"May God preserve us from [the sin of] detaining any other than him with whom we have found our property-for then, behold, we would indeed be evildoers!\"","1676":"And so, when they lost all hope of [moving] him, they withdrew to take counsel [among themselves]. The eldest of them said: \"Do you not remember that your father has bound you by a solemn pledge before God - and how, before that, you had failed with regard to Joseph? Hence, I shall not depart from this land till my father gives me leave or God passes judgment in my favour: for He is the best of all judges.","1677":"[And as for you others,] return to your father and say: `O our father! Behold, thy son has stolen-but we [can] bear witness to no more than what has become known to us; and [although we gave you our pledge,] we could not guard against something that [lay hidden in the future and, hence,] was beyond the reach of our perception.","1678":"And ask thou in the town in which we were [at the time], and of the people of the caravan with whom we travelled hither, and [thou wilt find that] we, are indeed telling the truth!\"'","1679":"[AND WHEN they returned to their father and told him what had happened,] he exclaimed: \"Nay, but it is your [own] minds that have made [so terrible] a happening seem a matter of little account to you! But [as for myself,] patience in adversity is most goodly; God may well bring them all [back] unto me: verily, He alone is all-knowing, truly wise!\"","1680":"But he turned away from them and said: \"O woe is me for Joseph!\"-and his eyes became dim from the grief with which he was filled.","1681":"Said [his sons]: \"By God! Thou wilt never cease to remember, Joseph till thou art broken in body and spirit or art dead!\"","1682":"He answered: \"It is only to God that I complain of my deep grief and my sorrow: for I know, from God, something that you do not know.","1683":"[Hence,] O my sons, go forth and try to obtain some tidings of Joseph and his brother; and do not lose hope of God's life-giving mercy: verily, none but people who deny the truth can ever lose hope of God's life-giving mercy.","1684":"[AND THE SONS of Jacob went back to Egypt and to Joseph;] and when they presented themselves before him, they said: \"O thou great one! Hardship has visited us and our folk, and so we have brought but scanty merchandise; but give us a full measure [of grain], and be charitable to us: behold, God rewards those who give in charity!\"","1685":"Replied he: \"Do you remember what you did to Joseph and his brother when you were still unaware [of right and wrong]?\"","1686":"They exclaimed: \"Why - is it indeed thou who art Joseph?\" He answered: \"I am Joseph, and this is my brother. God has indeed been gracious unto us. Verily, if one is conscious of Him and patient in adversity behold, God does not fail to requite the doers of good!\"","1687":"[The brothers] said: \"By God! Most certainly has God raised thee high above us, and we were indeed but sinners!\"","1688":"Said he: \"No reproach shall be uttered today against you. May God forgive you your sins: for He is the most merciful of the merciful!","1689":"[And now] go and take this tunic of mine and lay it over my father's face, and he will recover his sight. And thereupon come [back] to me with all your family.\"","1690":"AND AS SOON as the caravan [with which Jacob's sons were travelling] was on its way, their father said [to the people around him]: \"Behold, were it not that you might consider me a dotard, [I would say that] I truly feel the breath of Joseph [in the air]!\"","1691":"They answered: \"By God! Thou art indeed still lost in thy old aberration!\"","1692":"But when the bearer of good tidings came [with Joseph's tunic], he laid it over his face; and he regained his sight, [and] exclaimed: \"Did I not tell you, `Verily, I know, from God, something that you do not know'?\"","1693":"[His sons] answered: \"O our father! Ask God to forgive us our sins, for, verily, we were sinners.\"","1694":"He said: \"I shall ask my Sustainer to forgive you: He alone is truly forgiving, a true dispenser of grace!\"","1695":"AND WHEN they [all arrived in Egypt and] presented themselves before Joseph, he drew his parents unto himself, saying, \"Enter Egypt! If God so wills, you shall be secure [from all evil]!\"","1696":"And he raised his parents to the highest place of honour; and they [all] fell down before Him, prostrating themselves in adoration. Thereupon [Joseph] said: \"O my father! This is the real meaning of my dream of long ago, which my Sustainer has made come true. And He was indeed good to me when He freed me from the prison, and [when] He brought you [all unto me] from the desert after Satan had sown discord between me and my brothers.

Thou hast indeed bestowed upon me something of power, and hast imparted unto me some knowledge of the inner meaning of happenings. Originator of the heavens and the earth!

Have, then, they [who reject this divine writ] never journeyed about the earth and beheld what happened in the end to those [deniers of the truth] who lived before them?-and [do they not know that] to those who are conscious of God the life in the hereafter is indeed better [than this world]? Will they not, then, use their reason?","1706":"[All the earlier apostles had to suffer persecution for a long time;] but at last -when those apostles had lost all hope and saw themselves branded as liars - Our succour attained to them: whereupon everyone whom We Milled [to be saved] was saved [and the deniers of the truth were destroyed]: for, never can Our punishment be averted from people who are lost in sin.","1707":"Indeed, in the stories of these men there is a lesson for those who are endowed with insight. [As for this revelation,] it could not possibly be a discourse invented [by man]: nay indeed, it is [a divine writ] confirming the truth of whatever there still remains [of earlier revelations], clearly spelling out everything, and [offering] guidance and grace unto people who will believe.","1708":"Alif. Lam. Mim. Ra. THESE ARE MESSAGES of revelation: and what has been bestowed upon thee from on high by thy Sustainer is the truth-yet most people will not believe [in it]?","1709":"It is God who has raised the heavens without any supports that you could see, and is established on the throne of His almightiness; and He [it is who] has made the sun and the moon subservient [to His laws], each running its course for a term set [by Him]. He governs all that exists. Clearly does He spell out these messages, so that you might be certain in your innermost that you are destined to meet your Sustainer [on Judgment Day].","1710":"And it is He who has spread the earth wide and placed on it firm mountains and running waters, and created thereon two sexes of every [kind of] plant; [and it is He who] causes the night to cover the day. Verily, in all this there are messages indeed for people who think!","1711":"And there are on earth [many] tracts of land close by one another [and yet widely differing from one another]; and [there are on it] vinyards, and fields of grain, and date-palms growing in clusters from one root or standing alone, [all] watered with the same water: and yet, some of them have We favoured above others by way of the food [which they provide for man and beast]. Verily, in all this there are messages indeed for people who use their reason!","1712":"BUT IF thou art amazed [at the marvels of God's creation], amazing, too, is their saying, \"What! After we have become dust, shall we indeed be [restored to life] in a new act of creation?\" It is they who [thus show that they] are bent on denying their Sustainer; and it is they who carry the shackles [of their own making] around their necks; and it is they who are destined for the fire, therein to abide.","1713":"And [since, O Prophet, they are bent on denying the truth,] they challenge thee to hasten the coming upon them of evil instead of [hoping for] good although [they ought to know that] the exemplary punishments [which they now deride] have indeed come to pass before their time. Now, behold, thy Sustainer is full of forgiveness unto men despite all their evildoing: but, behold, thy Sustainer is [also] truly severe in retribution!","1714":"However, they who are bent on denying the truth [refuse to believe and] say, \"Why has no miraculous sign ever been bestowed on him from on high by his Sustainer?\" [But] thou art only a warmer; and [in God] all people have a guide.","1715":"God knows what any female bears [in her womb], and by how much the wombs may fall short [in gestation], and by how much they may increase [the average period]: for with Him everything is [created] in accordance with its scope and purpose.","1716":"He knows all that is beyond the reach of a created being's perception as well as all that can be witnessed by a creature's senses or mind -the Great One, the One far above anything that is or could ever be!","1717":"It is all alike [to Him] whether any of you conceals his thought or brings it into the open, and whether he seeks to hide [his evil deeds] under the cover of night or walks [boldly] in the light of day,","1718":"[thinking that] he has hosts of helpers-both such as can be perceived by him and such as are hidden from him -that could preserve him from whatever God may have willed. Verily, God does not change men's condition unless they change their inner selves; and when God wills people to suffer evil [in consequence of their own evil deeds], there is none who could avert it: for they have none who could protect them from Him.","1719":"HE IT IS who displays before you the lightning, to give rise to [both] fear and hope, and calls heavy clouds into being;","1720":"and the thunder extols His limitless glory and praises Him, and [so do] the angels, in awe of Him; and He [it is who] lets loose the thunderbolts and strikes with them whom He wills. And yet, they stubbornly argue about God, notwithstanding [all evidence] that He alone has the power to contrive whatever His unfathomable wisdom wills!","1721":"Unto Him [alone] is due all prayer aiming at the Ultimate Truth, since those [other beings or powers] whom men invoke instead of God cannot respond to them in any way - [so that he who invokes them is] but like one who stretches his open hands towards water, [hoping] that it will reach his mouth, the while it never reaches him. Hence, the prayer of those who deny the truth amounts to no more than losing oneself in grievous error.","1722":"And before God prostrate themselves, willingly or unwillingly, all [things and beings] that are in the heavens and on earth, as do their shadows in the mornings and the evenings.","1723":"Say: \"Who is the Sustainer of the heavens and the earth?\" Say: \"[It is] God.\" Say: \"[Why,] then, do you take for your protectors, instead of Him, such as have it not within their power to bring benefit to, or avert harm from, themselves?\" Say: \"Can the blind and the seeing be deemed equal? -or can the depths of darkness and the light be deemed equal?\" Or do they [really] believe that there are, side by side with God, other divine powers that have created the like of what He creates, so that this act of creation appears to them to be similar [to His]? Say: \"God is the Creator of all things; and He is the One who holds absolute sway over all that exists.\"","1724":"[Whenever] He sends down water from the sky, and [once-dry] river-beds are running high according to their measure, the stream carries scum on its surface; and, likewise, from that [metal] which they smelt in the fire in order to make ornaments or utensils, [there rises] scum. In this way does God set forth the parable of truth and falsehood: for, as far as the scum is concerned, it passes away as [does all] dross; but that which is of benefit to man abides on earth. In this way does God set forth the parables","1725":"of those who have responded to their Sustainer with a goodly response, and of those who did not respond to Him. [As for the latter,] if they possessed all that is on earth, and twice as much, they would surely offer it as ransom [on the Day of Judgment]: a most evil reckoning awaits them, and their goal is hell: and how evil a resting-place!","1726":"CAN, THEN, he who knows that whatever has been bestowed from on high upon thee by thy Sustainer is the truth be deemed equal to one who is blind? Only they who are endowed with insight keep this in mind:","1727":"they who are true to their bond with God and never break their covenant;","1728":"and who keep together what God has bidden to be joined, and stand in awe of their Sustainer and fear the most evil reckoning [which awaits such as do not respond to Him];","1729":"and who are patient in adversity out of a longing for their Sustainer's countenance, and are constant in prayer, and spend on others, secretly and openly, out of what We provide for them as sustenance, and [who] repel evil with good. It is these that shall find their fulfilment in the hereafter:","1730":"gardens of perpetual bliss, which they shall enter together with the righteous from among their parents, their spouses, and their offspring; and the angels will come unto them from every gate [and will say]:","1731":"\"Peace be upon you, because you have persevered!\" How excellent, then, this fulfilment in the hereafter!","1732":"But as for those who break their bond with God after it has been established [in their nature], and cut asunder what God has bidden to be joined, and spread corruption on earth -their due is rejection [by God], and theirs is a most evil fate [in the life to come].","1733":"GOD GRANTS abundant sustenance, or gives it in scant measure, unto whomever He wills; and they [who are given abundance] rejoice in the life of this world - even though, as compared with the life to come, the life of this world is nought but -a fleeting pleasure.","1734":"NOW THOSE who are bent on denying the truth [of the Prophet's message] say, \"Why has no miraculous sign ever been bestowed upon him from on high by his Sustainer?\" Say: \"Behold, God lets go astray him who wills [to go astray], just as He guides unto Himself all who turn unto Him-","1735":"those who believe, and whose hearts find their rest in the remembrance of God - for, verily, in the remembrance of God [men's] hearts do find their rest-:","1736":"[and so it is that] they who attain to faith and do righteous deeds are destined for happiness [in this world] and the most beauteous of all goals [in the life to come]!\"","1737":"Thus have We raised thee [O Muhammad] as Our Apostle amidst a community [of unbelievers] before whose time [similar] communities have come and gone, so that thou might propound to them what We have revealed unto thee: for [in their ignorance] they deny the Most Gracious! Say: \"He is my Sustainer. There is no deity save Him. In Him have I placed my trust, and unto Him is my recourse!\"","1738":"Yet even if [they should listen to] a [divine] discourse by which mountains could be moved, or the earth cleft asunder, or the dead made to speak - [they who are bent on denying the truth would still refuse to believe in it]! Nay, but God alone has the power to decide what shall be. Have, then, they who have attained to faith not yet come to know that, had God so willed; He would indeed have guided all mankind aright? But as for those who are bent on denying the truth-in result of their [evil] deeds, sudden calamities will always befall them or will alight close to their homes; [and this will continue] until God's promise [of resurrection] is fulfilled: verily, God never fails to fulfil His promise!","1739":"And, indeed, [even] before thy time have [God's] apostles been derided, and for a while I gave rein to those who were [thus] bent on denying the truth: but then I took them to task - and how awesome was My retribution!","1740":"IS, THEN, HE who has every living being in His almighty care, [dealing with each] according to what it deserves -[is, then, He like anything else that exists]? And yet, they ascribe to other beings a share in God's divinity! Say: \"Give them any name [you please]: but do you [really think that you could] inform Him of anything on earth that He does not know-or [do you] but play with words?, Nay, goodly seems their false imagery to those who are bent on denying the truth, and so they are turned away from the [right] path: and he whom God lets go astray can never find any guide.","1741":"For such, there is suffering in the life of this world; but, truly, [their] suffering in the life to come will be harder still, and they will have none to shield them from God.","1742":"THE PARABLE of the paradise promised to those who are conscious of God [is that of a garden] through which running waters flow: [but, unlike an earthly garden,] its fruits will be everlasting, and [so will be] its shade. Such will be the destiny of those who remain conscious of God-just as the destiny of those who deny the truth will be the fire.","1743":"Hence, they unto whom We have vouchsafed this revelation rejoice at all that has been bestowed upon thee [O Prophet] from on high; but among the followers of other creeds there are such as deny the validity of some of it. Say [unto them, O Prophet]: \"I have only been bidden to worship God, and not to ascribe divine. powers to aught beside Him: unto Him do I call [all mankind], and He is my goal!\"","1744":"Thus, then, have We bestowed from on high this [divine writ] as an ordinance in the Arabic tongue. And, indeed, if thou shouldst defer to men's likes and dislikes after all the [divine] knowledge that has come unto thee, thou wouldst have none to protect thee from God, and none to shield thee [from Him].","1745":"And, truly, We sent forth apostles before thee, and We appointed for them wives and offspring; and it was not given to any apostle to produce a miracle save at God's behest. Every age has had its revelation:","1746":"God annuls or confirms whatever He wills [of His earlier messages] -for with Him is the source of all revelation.","1747":"BUT WHETHER We let thee see [in thy lifetime, O Prophet, the fulfilment of] some of what We have promised them, or whether We cause thee to die [before its fulfilment] - thy duty is no more than to deliver the message; and the reckoning is Ours.","1748":"Have, then, they [who deny the truth] never yet seen how We visit the earth [with Our punishment], gradually depriving it of all that is best thereon? For, [when] God judges, there is no power that could repel His judgment: and swift in reckoning is He!","1749":"Now those who lived before these [sinners] did, too, devise many a blasphemy -but the most subtle devising is that of God, who knows what each human being deserves: and the deniers of the truth will [in time] come to know to whom the future belongs.","1750":"And [if] they who are bent on denying the truth say [unto thee, O Prophet], \"Thou hast not been sent [by God]\", say thou: \"None can bear witness between me and you as God does; and [none can bear witness as does] he who truly understands this divine writ.","1751":"Alif.

None knows them [now] save God. There came unto them their apostles with all evidence of the truth -but they covered their mouths with their hands and answered: \"Behold, we refuse to regard as true the message with which you [claim to] have been entrusted; and, behold, we are in grave doubt, amounting to suspicion, about [the meaning of] your call to us!\"","1760":"Said the apostles sent unto them: \"Can there be any doubt about [the existence and oneness of] God, the Originator of the heavens and the earth? It is He who calls unto you, so that He may forgive you [whatever is past] of your sins and grant you respite until a term [set by Him is fulfilled].\" [But] they replied: \"You are nothing but mortal men like ourselves!

Thy Sustainer said unto the angels: \"Behold, I am about to create mortal man out of sounding clay, out of dark slime transmuted;","1831":"and when I have formed him fully and breathed into him of My spirit, fall down before him in prostration!","1832":"Thereupon the angels prostrated themselves, all of them together,","1833":"save Iblis: he refused to be among those who prostrated themselves.","1834":"Said He: \"O Iblis! What is thy reason for not being among those who have prostrated themselves?\"","1835":"[Iblis] replied: \"It is not for me to prostrate myself before mortal man whom Thou hast created out of sounding clay, out of dark slime transmuted!\"","1836":"Said He: \"Go forth, then, from this [angelic state]: for, behold, thou art [henceforth] accursed,","1837":"and [My] rejection shall be thy due until the Day of Judgment!\"","1838":"Said [Iblis]: \"Then, O my Sustainer, grant me a respite till the Day when all shall be raised from the dead!\"","1839":"Answered He: \"Verily, so be it: thou shalt be among those who are granted respite","1840":"till the Day the time whereof is known [to Me alone].\"","1841":"[Whereupon Iblis] said: \"O my Sustainer! Since Thou hast thwarted me, I shall indeed make [all that is evil] on earth seem goodly to them, and shall most certainly beguile them-into grievous error -","1842":"[all] save such of them as are truly Thy servants!\"","1843":"Said He: \"This is, with Me. a straight way:","1844":"verily, thou shalt have no power over My creatures- unless it be such as are [already] lost in grievous error and follow thee [of their own will]:","1845":"and for all such, behold, hell is the promised goal.","1846":"with seven gates leading into it, each gate receiving its allotted share of sinners. -","1847":"VERILY, those who are conscious of God [shall find themselves in the hereafter] amidst gardens and springs,","1848":"[having been received with the greeting,] \"Enter here in peace, secure!\"","1849":"And [by then] We shall have removed whatever unworthy thoughts or feelings may have been [lingering] in their breasts, [and they shall rest] as brethren, facing one another [in love] upon thrones of happiness.","1850":"No weariness shall ever touch them in this [state of bliss], and never shall they have to forgo it.","1851":"Tell My servants that I - I alone - am truly forgiving, a true dispenser of grace;","1852":"and [also,] that the suffering which I shall impose [on sinners] will indeed be a suffering most grievous.","1853":"AND TELL THEM [once again] about Abraham's guests -","1854":"[how,] when they presented themselves before him and bade him peace, he answered: \"Behold, we are afraid of you!\"","1855":"Said they: \"Fear not! Behold, we bring thee the glad tiding of [the birth of] a son who will be endowed with deep knowledge.\"","1856":"Said he: \"Do you give me this glad tiding despite the fact that old age has overtaken me?

And, behold, both these [sinful communities] lived by a highway, [to this day] plain to see","1882":"AND, [likewise,] indeed, the people of Al-Hijr gave the lie to [Our] message-bearers:","1883":"for We did vouchsafe them Our messages, but they obstinately turned their backs upon them-","1884":"notwithstanding that they had been wont [to enjoy Our blessings and] to hew out dwellings from the mountains, [wherein they could live] in security","1885":"and so the blast [of Our punishment] overtook them at early morn,","1886":"and of no avail to them was all [the power] that they had acquired.","1887":"AND [remember:] We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them without [an inner] truth; but, behold, the Hour [when this will become clear to all] is indeed yet to come. Hence, forgive [men's failings] with fair forbearance:","1888":"verily, thy Sustainer is the all-knowing Creator of all things!","1889":"AND, INDEED, We have bestowed upon thee seven of the oft repeated [verses], and [have, thus, laid open before thee] this sublime Qur'an:","1890":"[so] turn, not thine eyes [longingly] towards the worldly benefits which We have granted unto some of those [that deny the truth].

[On the Day of Judgment] We shall indeed call them to account, one and all,","1895":"for whatever they have done!","1896":"Hence, proclaim openly all that thou hast been bidden [to say], and leave alone all those who ascribe divinity to aught beside God:","1897":"verily, We shall suffice thee against all who [now] deride [this message - all]","1898":"who assert that there are, side by side with God, other divine powers as well: for in time they will come to know [the truth].","1899":"And well do We know that thy bosom is constricted by the [blasphemous] things that they say:","1900":"but extol thou thy Sustainer's limitless glory and praise Him, and be of those who prostrate themselves [before Him] in adoration,","1901":"and worship thy Sustainer till death comes to thee.","1902":"GOD'S JUDGMENT is [bound to] come: do not, therefore, call for its speedy advent! Limitless is He in His glory and sublimely exalted above anything to which men may ascribe a share in His divinity!","1903":"He causes the angels to descend with this divine inspiration, [bestowed] at His behest upon whomever He wills of His servants: \"Warn [all human beings] that there is no deity save Me: be, therefore, conscious of Me!\"","1904":"He has created the heavens and the earth in accordance with [an inner] truth; sublimely exalted is He above anything to which men may ascribe a share in His divinity!","1905":"He creates man out of a [mere] drop of sperm: and lo! this same being shows himself endowed with the power to think and to argue!","1906":"And He creates cattle: you derive warmth from them, and [various other] uses; and from them you obtain food;","1907":"and you find beauty in them when you drive them home in the evenings and when you take them out to pasture in the mornings.","1908":"And they carry your loads to [many] a place which [otherwise] you would be unable to reach without great hardship to yourselves. Verily, your Sustainer is most compassionate, a dispenser of grace!","1909":"And (it is He who creates] horses and mules and asses for you to ride, as well as for [their] beauty: and He will yet create things of which [today] you have no knowledge.","1910":"And [because He is your Creator,] it rests with God alone to show you the right path: yet there is [many a one] who swerves from it. However, had He so willed, He would have guided you all aright.","1911":"It is He who sends down water from the skies; you drink thereof, and thereof [drink] the plants upon which you pasture your beasts;","1912":"[and] by virtue thereof He causes crops to grow for you, and olive trees, and date palms, and grapes, and all [other] kinds of fruit: in this, behold, there is a message indeed for people who think!","1913":"And He has made the night and the day and the sun and the moon subservient [to His laws, so that they be of use] to you; and all the stars are subservient to His command: in this, behold, there are messages indeed for people who use their reason!","1914":"And all the [beauty of] many hues-which He has created for you on earth: in this, behold, there is a message for people who (are willing to] take it to heart!","1915":"And He it is who has made the sea subservient [to His laws], so that you might eat fresh meat from it, and take from it gems which you may wear. And on that [very sea] one sees ships ploughing through the waves, so that you might [be able to] go forth in quest of some of His bounty, and thus have cause to be grateful [to Him].","1916":"And he has placed firm mountains on earth, lest it sway with you, and rivers and paths, so that you might find your way,","1917":"as well as [various other] means of orientation: for [it is] by the stars that men find their way.","1918":"IS, THEN, HE who creates comparable to any [being] that cannot create? Will you not, then, bethink yourselves?","1919":"For, should you try to count God's blessings, you could never compute them! Behold, God is indeed much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace;","1920":"and God knows all that you keep secret as well as all that you bring into the open.","1921":"Now those beings that some people invoke beside God cannot create anything, since they themselves are but created:","1922":"they are dead, not living, and they do not [even] know when they will be raised from the dead!","1923":"Your God is the One God: but because of their false pride, the hearts of those who do not believe in the life to come refuse to admit this [truth].","1924":"Truly, God knows all that they keep secret as well as all that they bring into the open -[and,] behold, He does not love those who are given to arrogance,","1925":"and [who], whenever they are asked, \"What is it that your Sustainer has bestowed from on high?\"-are wont to answer, \"Fables of ancient times!\"","1926":"Hence, on Resurrection Day they shall bear the full weight of their own burdens, as well as some of the burdens of those ignorant ones whom they have led astray: oh, how evil the load with which they shall be burdened!","1927":"Those who lived before them did, too, devise many a blasphemy -whereupon God visited with destruction all that they had ever built, [striking] at its very foundations, so that the roof fell in upon them from above and suffering befell them without their having perceived whence it came.","1928":"And then, on Resurrection Day, He will cover them [all] with ignominy, and will say: \"Where, now, are those beings to whom you ascribed a share in My divinity, [and] for whose sake you cut yourselves off [from My guidance]?\" [Whereupon] those who [in their lifetime] were endowed with knowledge will say: \"Verily, ignominy and misery [have fallen] this day upon those who have been denying the truth-","1929":"those whom the angels have gathered in death while they were still sinning against themselves!\" Then will they [who are thus arraigned] proffer their submission, [saying:] \"We did not [mean to] do any evil! [But they will be answered:] \"Yea, verily, God has full knowledge of all that you were doing!","1930":"Hence, enter the gates of hell, therein to abide!\" And evil, indeed, shall be the state of all who are given to false pride!","1931":"But [when] those who are conscious of God are asked, \"What is it that your Sustainer has bestowed from on high?\" -they answer, \"Goodness supreme!\" Good fortune awaits, in this world, all who persevere in doing good; but their ultimate state will be far better still: for, how excellent indeed will be the state of the God-conscious [in the life to come]!","1932":"Gardens of perpetual bliss will they enter - [gardens] through which running waters flow - having therein all that they might desire. Thus will God reward those who are conscious of Him-","1933":"those whom the angels gather in death while they are in a state of inner purity, greeting them thus: \"Peace be upon you! Enter paradise by virtue of what you were doing [in life]!\"","1934":"ARE THEY [who deny the truth] but waiting for the angels to appear unto them, or for God's judgment to become manifest? Even thus did behave those [stubborn sinners] who lived before their time; and [when they were destroyed,] it was not God who wronged them, but it was they who had wronged themselves:","1935":"for all the evil that they had done fell [back] upon them, and they were overwhelmed by the very thing which they had been wont to deride.","1936":"Now they who ascribe divinity to aught beside God say, \"Had God so willed, we would not have worshipped aught but Him - neither we nor our forefathers; nor would we have declared aught as forbidden without a commandment from Him.\" Even thus did speak those [sinners] who lived before their time; but, then, are the apostles bound to do more than clearly deliver the message [entrusted to them]?","1937":"And indeed, within every community have We raised up an apostle [entrusted with this message]: \"Worship God, and shun the powers of evil!\" And among those [past generations] were people whom God graced with His guidance, just as there was among them [many a one] who inevitably fell prey to grievous error: go, then, about the earth and behold what happened in the end to those who gave the lie to the truth!","1938":"[As for those who are bent on denying the truth-] though thou be ever so eager to show them the right way, [know that,] verily, God does not bestow His guidance upon any whom He judges to have gone astray; and such shall have none to succour them [on Resurrection Day].","1939":"As it is, they swear by God with their most solemn oaths, \"Never will God raise from the dead anyone who has died!\" Yea indeed! [This very thing has God promised] by a promise which He has willed upon Himself; but most people know it not.","1940":"[He will resurrect them] to the end that He might make clear unto them all whereon they [now] hold divergent views, and that they who are bent on denying the truth [of resurrection] might come to know that they were liars.","1941":"Whenever We will anything to be, We but say unto it Our word \"Be\" -and it is.","1942":"NOW as for those who forsake the domain of evil in the cause of God, after having suffered wrong [on account of their faith] - We shall most certainly grant them a station of good fortune in this world: but their reward in the life to come will be far greater yet.

And upon thee [too] have We bestowed from on high this reminder, so that thou might make clear unto mankind all that has ever been thus bestowed upon them, and that they might take thought.","1946":"Can, then, they who devise evil schemes ever feel sure that God will not cause the earth to swallow them, or that suffering will not befall them without their perceiving whence [it came]? -","1947":"or that He will not take them to task [suddenly] in the midst of their comings and goings, without their being able to elude [Him],","1948":"or take them to task through slow decay? And yet, behold, your Sustainer is most compassionate, a dispenser of grace!","1949":"HAVE, THEN, they [who deny the truth] never considered any of the things that God has created _ (how] their shadows turn right and left, prostrating themselves before God and utterly submissive [to His will]?","1950":"For, before God prostrates itself all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth - every beast that moves, and the angels: [even] these do not bear themselves with false pride:","1951":"they fear their Sustainer high above them, and do whatever they are bidden to do.","1952":"And God has said: \"Do not take to worshipping two [or more] deities. He is the One and Only God: hence, of Me, of Me alone stand in awe!\"","1953":"And His is all that is in the heavens and on earth, and to Him [alone] obedience is always due: will you, then, pay reverence to aught but Him?","1954":"For, whatever good thing comes to you, comes from God; and whenever harm befalls you, it is unto Him that you cry for help","1955":"yet as soon as He has removed the harm from you, lo! some of you [begin to] ascribe to other powers a share 'in their Sustainer's divinity","1956":"[as if] to prove their ingratitude for all that We have granted them! Enjoy, then, your [brief] life: but in time you will come to know [the truth]!","1957":"As it is, they ascribe - out of what We provide for them as sustenance - a share unto things of which they know nothing. By God, you shall most certainly be called to account for all your false imagery!","1958":"And [thus, too,] they ascribe daughters unto God, who is limitless in His glory - whereas for themselves [they would choose, if they could, only] what they desire:","1959":"for, whenever any of them is given the glad tiding of [the birth of] a girl, his face darkens, and he is filled with suppressed anger,","1960":"avoiding all people because of the [alleged] evil of the glad tiding which he has received, [and debating within himself:] Shall he keep this [child] despite the contempt [which he feels for it]-or shall he bury it in the dust?

However, He grants them respite until a term set [by Him]: but when the end of their term approaches, they can neither delay it by a single moment, nor can they hasten it.","1963":"As it is, they ascribe to God something that they [themselves] dislike -and [all the while] their tongues utter the lie that [by doing so] they earn supreme merit! Truly, they earn but the fire, and will be left out [of God's grace]!","1964":"By God, [O Prophet,] even before thy time have We sent apostles unto [various] communities: but [those who were bent on denying the truth have always refused to listen to Our messages because] Satan has made all their own doings seem goodly to them: and he is [as] close to them today [as he was to the sinners of yore]; hence, grievous suffering awaits them.","1965":"And upon thee [too] have We bestowed from on' high this divine writ for no other reason than that thou might make clear unto them all [questions of faith] on which they have come to hold divergent views, and [thus offer] guidance and grace unto people who will believe.","1966":"AND GOD sends down water from the skies, giving life thereby to the earth after it had been lifeless: in this, behold, there is a message indeed for people who [are willing to] listen.","1967":"And, behold, in the cattle [too] there is indeed a lesson for you: We give you to drink of that [fluid] which is [secreted from] within their bellies between that which is to be eliminated [from the animal's body] and [its] life-blood: milk pure and pleasant to those who drink it.","1968":"And [We grant you nourishment] from the fruit of date-palms and vines: from it you derive intoxicants as well as wholesome sustenance -in this, behold, there is a message indeed for people who use their reason!","1969":"And [consider how] thy Sustainer has inspired the bee: \"Prepare for thyself dwellings in mountains and in trees, and in what [men] may build [for thee by way of hives];","1970":"and then eat of all manner of fruit, and follow humbly the paths ordained for thee by thy Sustainer.\" [And lo!] there issues from within these [bees] a fluid of many hues, wherein there is health for man. In all this, behold, there is a message indeed for people who think!","1971":"AND GOD has created you, and in time will cause you to die; and many a one of you is reduced in old age to a most abject state, ceasing to know anything of what he once knew so well. Verily, God is all-knowing, infinite in His power!","1972":"And on some of you God has bestowed more abundant means of sustenance than on others: and yet, they who are more abundantly favoured are [often] unwilling to share their sustenance with those whom their right hands possess, so that they [all] might be equal in this respect. Will they, then, God's blessings [thus] deny?","1973":"And God has given you mates of your own kinds and has given you, through your mates, children and children's children, and has provided for you sustenance out of the good things of life.

Can these [two] be deemed equal?

In this, behold, there are messages indeed for people who will believe!","1981":"And God has given you [the ability to build] your houses as places of rest, and has endowed you with [the skill to make] dwellings out of the skins of animals - easy for you to handle when you travel and when you camp -and [to make] furnishings and goods for temporary use of their [rough] wool and their soft, furry wool and their hair.","1982":"And among the many objects of His creation, God has appointed for you [various] means of protection: thus, He has given you in the mountains places of shelter, and has endowed you with [the ability to make] garments to protect you from heat [and cold], as well as such garments as might protect you from your [mutual] violence. In this way does He bestow the full measure of His blessings on you, so that you might surrender yourselves unto Him.","1983":"BUT IF they turn away [from thee, O Prophet, remember that] thy only duty is a clear delivery of the message [entrusted to thee].","1984":"They [who turn away from it] are fully aware of God's blessings, but none the less they refuse to acknowledge them [as such], since most of them are given to denying the truth.","1985":"But one Day We shall raise up a witness out of every community, whereupon they who were bent on denying the truth will not be allowed to plead [ignorance], and neither will they be allowed to make amends.","1986":"And when they who were bent on evildoing behold the suffering [that awaits them, they will realize that] it will not be lightened for them [by virtue of their pleading]; and neither will they be granted respite.","1987":"And when they who were wont to ascribe divinity to beings other than God behold [on Judgment Day] those beings to whom they were wont to ascribe a share in His divinity, they will exclaim: \"O our Sustainer! These are the beings to whom we ascribed a share in Thy divinity, and whom we were wont to invoke instead of Thee!\" -whereupon [those beings] will fling at them the retort: \"Behold, you have indeed been lying [to yourselves]!\"","1988":"And on that Day will they [who had thus been sinning, belatedly] proffer their surrender to God; and all their false imagery will have forsaken them.","1989":"Upon all who were bent on denying the truth and who turned others away from the path of God will We heap suffering upon suffering in return for all the corruption that they wrought:","1990":"for one Day We shall raise up within every community a witness against them from among themselves. And thee [too, O Prophet,] have We brought forth to bear witness regarding those [whom thy message may have reached], inasmuch as We have bestowed from on high upon thee, step by step, this divine writ, to make everything clear, and to provide guidance and grace and a glad tiding unto all who have surrendered themselves to God.","1991":"BEHOLD, God enjoins justice, and the doing of good, and generosity towards [one's] fellow-men; and He forbids all that is shameful and all that runs counter to reason, as well as envy; [and] He exhorts you [repeatedly] so that you might bear [all this] in mind.","1992":"And be true to your bond with God whenever you bind yourselves by a pledge, and do not break [your] oaths after having [freely] confirmed them and having called upon God to be witness to your good faith: behold, God knows all that you do.","1993":"Hence, be not like her who breaks and completely untwists the yarn which she [herself] has spun and made strong-[be not like this by] using your oaths as a means of deceiving one another, simply because some of you may be more powerful than others.\" By all this, God but puts you to a test-and [He does it] so that on Resurrection Day He might make clear unto you all that on which you were wont to differ.","1994":"For, had God so willed, He could surely have made you all one single community; however, He lets go astray him that wills [to go astray], and guides aright him that wills [to be guided]; and you will surely be called to account for all that you ever did!","1995":"And do not use your oaths as a means of deceiving one another-or else [your] foot will slip after having been firm, and then you will have to taste the evil [consequences] of your having turned away from the path of God, with tremendous suffering awaiting you [in the life to come].","1996":"Hence, do not barter away your bond with God for a trifling gain! Verily, that which is with God is by far the best for you, if you but knew it:","1997":"all that is with you is bound to come to an end, whereas that which is with God is everlasting. And most certainly shall We grant unto those who are patient in adversity their reward in accordance with the best that they ever did.","1998":"As for anyone - be it man or woman - who does righteous deeds, and is a believer withal - him shall We most certainly cause to live a good life. and most certainly shall We grant unto such as these their reward in accordance with the best that they ever did.","1999":"NOW whenever thou happen to read this Qur'an, seek refuge with God from Satan, the accursed.","2000":"Behold, he has no power over those who have attained to faith and in their Sustainer place their tray trust:","2001":"he has power only over those who are willing to follow him, and who [thus] ascribe to him a share in God's divinity.","2002":"And now that We replace one message by another -since God is fully aware of what He bestows from on high, step by step - they [who deny the truth] are wont to say, \"Thou but inventest it!\" Nay, but most of them do not understand it!","2003":"Say: \"Holy inspiration has brought it down from thy Sustainer by stages, setting forth the truth, so that it might give firmness unto those who have attained to faith, and provide guidance and a glad tiding unto all who have surrendered themselves to God.\"","2004":"And, indeed, full well do We know that they say, \"It is but a human being that imparts [all] this to him! -[notwithstanding that] the tongue of him to whom they so maliciously point is wholly outlandish, whereas this is Arabic speech, clear [in itself] and clearly showing the truth [of its source].","2005":"Verily, as for those who will not believe in God's messages, God does not guide them aright; and grievous suffering will be their lot [in the life to come].","2006":"It is but they who will not believe in God's messages that invent this falsehood; and it is they, they who are lying!","2007":"As for anyone who denies God after having once attained to faith-and this, to be sure, does not apply to one who does it under duress, the while his heart remains true to his faith, but [only, to] him who willingly opens up his heart to a denial of the truth-: upon all such [falls] God's condemnation, and tremendous suffering awaits them:","2008":"all this, because they hold this world's life in greater esteem than the life to come, and because God does not bestow His guidance upon people who deny the truth.","2009":"They whose hearts and whose hearing and whose sight God has sealed -it is they, they who are heedless!","2010":"Truly it is they, they who in the life to come shall be the losers!","2011":"And yet, behold, thy Sustainer [grants His forgiveness] unto those who forsake the domain of evil after having succumbed to its temptation, and who thenceforth strive hard [in God's cause] and are patient in adversity: behold, after such [repentance] thy Sustainer is indeed much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace!","2012":"[Be conscious, then, of] the Day when every human being shall come to plead for himself [alone], and every human being shall be repaid in full for whatever he has done, and none shall be wronged.","2013":"AND GOD propounds [to you] a parable: [Imagine] a town which was [once] secure and at ease, with its sustenance coming to it abundantly from all quarters, and which thereupon blasphemously refused to show gratitude for God's blessings: and therefore God caused it to taste the all-embracing misery of hunger and fear in result of all [the evil] that its people had so persistently wrought.","2014":"And indeed, there had come unto them an apostle from among themselves -but they gave him the lie; and therefore suffering overwhelmed them while they were thus doing wrong [to themselves].","2015":"AND SO, partake of all the lawful, good things which God has provided for you as sustenance, and render thanks unto God for His blessings, if it is [truly] Him that you worship.","2016":"He has forbidden to you only carrion, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that over which any name other than God's has been invoked; but if one is driven [to it] by necessity - neither coveting it nor exceeding his immediate need -verily, God is much forgiving, a dispenser of grace.","2017":"Hence, do not utter falsehoods by letting your tongues determine [at your own discretion], \"This is lawful and that is forbidden\", thus attributing your own lying inventions to God: for, behold, they who attribute their own lying inventions to God will never attain to a happy state!","2018":"A brief enjoyment [may be theirs in this world] -but grievous suffering awaits them [in the life to come]!","2019":"And [only] unto those who followed the Jewish faith did We forbid all that We have mentioned to thee ere this; and no wrong did We do to them, but it was they who persistently wronged themselves.","2020":"And once again: Behold, thy Sustainer [shows mercy] to those who do evil out of ignorance and afterwards repent and live righteously: behold, after such [repentance] thy Sustainer is indeed much forgiving, a dispenser of grace.","2021":"VERILY, Abraham was a man who combined within himself all virtues, devoutly obeying God's will, turning away from all that is false, and not being of those who ascribe divinity to aught beside God:","2022":"[for he was always] grateful for the blessings granted by Him who had elected him and guided him onto a straight way.","2023":"And so We vouchsafed him good in this world; and, verily, in the life to come [too] he shall find himself among the righteous.","2024":"And lastly, We have inspired thee, [O Muhammad, with this message:] \"Follow the creed of Abraham, who turned away from all that is false, and was not of those who ascribe divinity to aught beside God;","2025":"[and know that the observance of] the Sabbath was ordained only for those who came to hold divergent views about him;

but to bear yourselves with patience is indeed far better for (you, since God is with] those who are patient in adversity.","2028":"Endure, then, with patience (all that they who deny the truth may say] -always remembering that it is none but God who gives thee the strength to endure adversity -and do not grieve over them, and neither be distressed by the false arguments which they devise:","2029":"for, verily, God is with those who are conscious of Him and are doers of good withal!","2030":"LIMITLESS in His glory is He who transported His servant by night from the Inviolable House of Worship [at Mecca] to the Remote House of Worship [, at Jerusalem] - the environs of which We had blessed -so that We might show him some of Our symbols: for, verily, He alone is all-hearing, all-seeing.","2031":"And [thus, too,] We vouchsafed revelation unto Moses, and made it a [source of] guidance for the children of Israel, [commanding them:] \"Do not ascribe to any but Me the power to determine your fate,","2032":"O you descendants of those whom We caused to be borne (in the ark] with Noah! Behold, he was a most grateful servant (of Ours]!\"","2033":"And we made [this] known to the children of Israel through revelation: Twice, indeed, will you spread corruption on earth and will indeed become grossly overbearing!","2034":"Hence, when the prediction of the first of those two [periods of iniquity] came true, We sent against you some of Our bondmen of terrible prowess in war, and they wrought havoc throughout the land: and so the prediction was fulfilled.","2035":"And after a time We allowed you to prevail against them once again, and aided you with wealth and offspring, and made you more numerous [than ever].","2036":"[And We said:] \"If you persevere in doing good, you will but be doing good to yourselves; and if you do evil, it will be [done] to yourselves.\" And so, when the prediction of the second [period of your iniquity] came true, [We raised new enemies against you, and allowed them] to disgrace you utterly, and to enter the Temple as [their forerunners] had entered it once before, and to destroy with utter destruction all that they had conquered.","2037":"Your Sustainer may well show mercy unto you; but if you revert [to sinning], We shall revert [to chastising you]. And [remember this:] We have ordained that [in the hereafter] hell shall close upon all who deny the truth.","2038":"VERILY, this Qur'an shows the way to all that is most upright, and gives the believers who do good deeds the glad tiding that theirs will be a great reward;","2039":"and [it announces, too,] that We have readied grievous suffering for those who will not believe in the life to come.","2040":"As it is, man [often] prays for things that are bad as if he were praying for something that is good: for man is prone to be hasty [in his judgments].","2041":"And We have established the night and the day as two symbols; and thereupon We have effaced the symbol of night and set up [in its place] the light giving symbol of day, so that you might seek to obtain your Sustainer's bounty and be aware of the passing years and of the reckoning [that is bound to come]. For clearly, most clearly, have We spelt out everything!","2042":"And every human being's destiny have We tied to his neck; and on the Day of Resurrection We shall bring forth for him a record which he will find wide open;","2043":"[and he will be told:] \"Read this thy record,! Sufficient is thine own self today to make out thine account!\"","2044":"Whoever chooses to follow the right path, follows it but for his own good; and whoever goes astray, goes but astray to his own hurt; and no bearer of burdens shall be made to bear another\" burden. Moreover. We would never chastise [any community for the wrong they may do] ere We have sent an apostle [to them].","2045":"But when [this has been done, and] it is Our will to destroy a community, We convey Our last warning to those of its people who have lost themselves entirely in the pursuit of pleasures; and [if] they [continue to] act sinfully, the sentence [of doom] passed on the community takes effect, and We break it to smithereens.","2046":"And how many a generation have We [thus] destroyed after [the time of] Noah! For, none has the like of thy Sustainer's awareness and insight into His creatures' sins.","2047":"Unto him who cares for [no more than the enjoyment of] this fleeting life We readily grant thereof as much as We please, [giving] to whomever it is Our will [to give]; but in the end We consign him to [the suffering of] hell; which he will have to endure disgraced and disowned!","2048":"But as for those who care for the [good of the] life to come, and strive for it as it ought to be striven for, and are [true] believers withal -they are the ones whose striving finds favour [with God]!","2049":"All [of them] -these as well as those -do We freely endow with some of thy Sustainer's gifts, since thy Sustainer's giving is never confined [to one kind of man].","2050":"Behold how We bestow [on earth) more bounty on some of them than on others: but [remember that] the life to come will be far higher in degree and far greater in merit and bounty.","2051":"DO NOT set up any other deity side by side with God, lest thou find thyself disgraced and forsaken:","2052":"for thy Sustainer has ordained that you shall worship none but Him.

Bestow on us grace from Thyself, and endow us, whatever our [outward] condition, with consciousness of what is right!\"","2151":"And thereupon We veiled their ears in the cave for many a year,","2152":"and then We awakened Christianity was no longer persecuted and had even become the official religion of the Roman Empire. The ancient coin (dating from the reign of Decius) with which the young man wanted to pay for his purchases immediately aroused curiosity; people began to question the stranger, and the story of the Men of the Cave and their miraculous sleep came to light. them: [and We did all this] so that We might mark out [to the world] which of the two points of view showed a better comprehension of the time-span during which they had remained in this state.","2153":"[And now] We shall truly relate to thee their story: Behold, they were young men who had attained to faith in their Sustainer: and [so] We deepened their consciousness of the right way","2154":"and endowed their hearts with strength, so that they stood up and said [to one another]: \"Our Sustainer is the Sustainer of the heavens and the earth. Never shall we invoke any deity other than Him: [if we did,] we should indeed have uttered an enormity!","2155":"These people of ours have taken to worshipping [other] deities instead of Him, without being able to adduce any reasonable evidence in support of their beliefs; and who could be more wicked than he who invents a lie about God?","2156":"Hence, now that you have withdrawn from them and from all that they worship instead of God, take refuge in that cave: God will spread His grace over you, and will endow you - whatever your [outward] condition - with all that your souls may need!","2157":"And [for many a year] thou might have seen the sun, on its rising, incline away from their cave on the right, and, on its setting, turn aside from them on the left, while they lived on in that spacious chamber, [bearing witness to] this of God's messages: He whom God guides, he alone has found the right way; whereas for him whom He lets go astray thou canst never find any protector who would point out the right way.","2158":"And thou wouldst have thought that they were awake, whereas they lay asleep. And We caused them to turn over repeatedly, now to the right, now to the left; and their dog [lay] on the threshold, its forepaws outstretched.

One of them asked: \"How long have you remained thus?\" [The others] answered: \"We have remained thus a day, or part of a day.\" Said they [who were endowed with deeper insight]: \"Your Sustainer knows best how long you have thus remained. Let, then, one of you go with these silver coins to the town, and let him find out what food is purest there, and bring you thereof [some] provisions. But let him behave with great care and by no means make anyone aware of you:","2160":"for, behold, if they should come to know of you, they might stone you to death or force you back to their faith-in which case you would never attain to any good!\"","2161":"AND IN THIS way have We drawn [people's] attention to their story, so that they might know - whenever they debate among themselves as to what happened to those [Men of the Cave] that God's promise [of resurrection] is true, and that there can be no doubt as to [the coming of] the Last Hour. And so, some [people] said: \"Erect a building in their memory; God knows best what happened to them.\" Said they whose opinion prevailed in the end: \"Indeed, we must surely raise a house of worship in their memory!\"","2162":"[And in times to come] some will say, \"[They were] three, the fourth of them being their dog,\" while others will say, \"Five, with their dog as the sixth of them\" -idly guessing at something of which they can have no knowledge -and [so on, until] some will say, \"[They were] seven, the eighth of them being their dog.\" Say: \"My Sustainer knows best how many they were. None but a few have any [real] knowledge of them. Hence, do not argue about them otherwise than by way of an obvious argument, and do not ask any of those [story-tellers] to enlighten thee about them.\"","2163":"AND NEVER say about anything, \"Behold, I shall do this tomorrow,\"","2164":"without (adding], \"if God so wills.\" And if thou shouldst forget [thyself at the time, and become aware of it later], call thy Sustainer to mind and say: \"I pray that my Sustainer guide me, even closer than this, to a consciousness of what is right!\"","2165":"AND [some people assert], \"They remained in their cave three hundred years\"; and some have added nine [to that number].","2166":"Say: \"God knows best how long they remained [there].

There is nothing that could alter His words; and thou canst find no refuge other than with Him.","2168":"And contain thyself in patience by the side of all who at morn and at evening invoke their Sustainer, seeking His countenance, and let not thine eyes pass beyond them in quest of the beauties of this world's life; and pay no heed to any whose heart We have rendered heedless of all remembrance of Us because he had always followed [only] his own desires, abandoning all that is good and true.","2169":"And say: \"The truth [has now come] from your Sustainer: let, then, him who wills, believe in it, and let him who wills, reject it.\" Verily, for all who sin against themselves [by rejecting Our truth] We have readied a fire whose billowing folds will encompass them from all sides; and if they beg for water, they will be given water [hot] like molten lead, which will scald their faces: how dreadful a drink, and how evil a place to rest!","2170":"[But,] behold, as for those who attain to faith and do righteous deeds-verily, We do not fail to requite any who persevere in doing good:","2171":"theirs shall be gardens of perpetual bliss - [gardens] through which running waters flow - wherein they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and will wear green garments of silk and brocade, [and] wherein upon couches they will recline:\" how excellent a recompense, and how goodly a place to rest!","2172":"AND PROPOUND unto them the parable of two men, upon one of whom We had bestowed two vinyards, and surrounded them with date-palms, and placed a field of grain in-between.","2173":"Each of the two gardens yielded its produce and never failed therein in any way, for We had caused a stream to gush forth in the midst of each of them.","2174":"And so [the man] had fruit in abundance. And [one day] he said to his friend, bandying words with him, \"More wealth have I than thou, and mightier am I as regards [the number and power of my] followers!\"","2175":"And having [thus] sinned against himself, he entered his garden, saying, \"I do not think that this will ever perish!","2176":"And neither do I think that the Last Hour will ever come. But even if [it should come, and] I am brought before my Sustainer, I will surely find something even better than this as [my last] resort!\"","2177":"And his friend answered him in the course of their argument: \"Wilt thou blaspheme against Him who has created thee out of dust, and then out of a drop of sperm, and in the end has fashioned thee into a [complete] man?","2178":"But as for myself, [I. know that] He is God, my Sustainer; and I cannot attribute divine powers to any but my Sustainer.\"","2179":"And [he continued:] \"Alas, if thou hadst but said, on entering thy garden, `Whatever God wills [shall come to pass, for] there is no power save with God!' Although, as thou seest, I have less wealth and offspring than thou,","2180":"yet it may well be that my Sustainer will give me something better than thy garden -just as He may let loose a calamity out of heaven upon this [thy garden], so that it becomes a heap of barren dust","2181":"or its water sinks deep into the ground, so that thou wilt never be able to find it again!\"","2182":"And [thus it happened:] his fruitful gardens were encompassed [by ruin], and there he was, wringing his hands over all that he had spent on that which now lay waste, with its trellises caved in; and he could but say, \"Oh, would that I had not attributed divine powers to any but my Sustainer!\"","2183":"-for now he had nought to succour him in God's stead, nor could he succour himself.","2184":"For thus it is: all protective power belongs to God alone, the True One. He is the best to grant recompense, and the best to determine what is to be.","2185":"AND PROPOUND unto them the parable of the life of this world: [it is] like the water which We send down from the skies, and which is absorbed by the plants of the earth: but [in time] they turn into dry. stubble which the winds blow freely about. And it is God [alone] who determines all things.","2186":"Wealth and children are an adornment of this, world's life: but good deeds, the fruit whereof endures forever, are of far greater merit in thy Sustainer's sight, and a far better source of hope.","2187":"Hence, [bear in mind] the Day, on which We shall cause the mountains to disappear and thou shalt behold the earth void and bare: for [on that Day] We will [resurrect the dead and] gather them all together, leaving out none of them.","2188":"And they will be lined up before thy Sustainer, [and He will say:] \"Now, indeed, you have come unto Us [in a lonely state], even as We created you in the first instances - although you were wont to assert that We would never 'appoint for you a meeting [with Us]!\"","2189":"And the record [of everyone's deeds] will be laid open; and thou wilt behold the guilty filled with dread at what [they see] therein; and they will exclaim: \"Oh, woe unto us!

[In the course of his wanderings,] Moses said to his servant: \"I shall not give up until I reach the junction of the two seas, even if I [have to] spend untold years [in my quest]!\"","2201":"But when they reached the junction between the two [seas], they forgot all about their fish, and it took its way into the sea and disappeared from sight.","2202":"And after the two had walked some distance, [Moses] said to his servant: \"Bring us our mid-day meal; we have indeed suffered hardship on this [day of] our journey!\"","2203":"Said [the servant]: \"Wouldst thou believe it?

How strange!\"","2204":"[Moses] exclaimed: \"That [was the place] which we were seeking!, And the two turned back, retracing their footsetps,","2205":"and found one of Our servants, on whom We had bestowed grace from Ourselves and unto whom We had imparted knowledge [issuing] from Ourselves.","2206":"Moses said unto him: \"May I follow thee on the understanding that thou wilt impart to me something of that consciousness of what is right which has been imparted to thee?\"","2207":"[The other] answered: \"Behold, thou wilt never be able to have patience with me –","2208":"for how couldst thou be patient about something that thou canst not comprehend within the compass of (thy] experience?\"","2209":"Replied [Moses]: \"Thou wilt find me patient, if God so wills; and I shall not disobey thee in anything!\"","2210":"Said [the sage]: \"Well, then, if thou art to follow me, do not question me about aught [that I may do] until I myself give thee an account thereof.\"","2211":"And so the two went on their way, till (they reached the seashore; and] when they disembarked from the boat [that had ferried them across], the sage made a hole in it-[whereupon Moses] exclaimed: \"Hast thou made a hole in it in order to drown the people who may be [travelling] in it? Indeed, thou hast done a grievous thing!\"","2212":"He replied: \"Did I not tell thee that thou wilt never be able to have patience with me?\"","2213":"Said [Moses]: \"Take-me not to task for my having forgotten [myself], and be not hard on me on account of what I have done!\"","2214":"And so the two went on, till, when they met a young man, [the sage] slew him -(whereupon Moses] exclaimed: \"Hast thou slain an innocent human being without [his having taken] another man's life?

None the less, there shall most certainly come unto you guidance from Me: and he who follows My guidance will not go astray, and neither will he be unhappy.","2472":"But as for him who shall turn away from remembering Me - his shall be a life of narrow scope and on the Day of Resurrection We shall raise him up blind.\"","2473":"[And so, on Resurrection Day, the sinner] will ask: \"O my Sustainer! Why hast Thou raised me up blind, whereas [on earth] I was endowed with sight?\"","2474":"[God] will reply: \"Thus it is: there came unto thee Our messages, but thou wert oblivious of them; and thus shalt thou be today consigned to oblivion!\"","2475":"For, thus shall We recompense him who wastes his own self and does not believe in his Sustainer's messages: and, indeed, the suffering [of such sinners] in the life to come shall be most severe and most enduring!","2476":"CAN, THEN, they [who reject the truth] learn no lesson by recalling how many a generation We have destroyed before their time? - [people] in whose dwelling-places they [themselves now] walk about? In this, behold, there are messages indeed for those who are endowed with reason!","2477":"Now were it not for a decree that has already gone forth from thy Sustainer, setting a term [for each sinner's repentance], it would inescapably follow [that all who sin must be doomed at once].","2478":"Hence, bear with patience whatever they [who deny the truth] may say, and extol thy Sustainer's limitless glory and praise Him before the rising of the sun and before its setting; and extol His glory, too, during some of the hours of the night as well as during the hours of the day, so that thou might attain to happiness.","2479":"And never turn thine, eyes [with longing] towards whatever splendour of this world's life We may have allowed so many others to enjoy in order that We might test them thereby: for the sustenance which thy Sustainer provides [for thee] is better and more enduring.","2480":"And bid thy people to pray, and persevere therein. [But remember:] We do not ask thee to provide sustenance [for Us]: it is We who provide sustenance for thee. And the future belongs to the God-conscious.","2481":"NOW THEY [who are blind to the truth] are wont to say, \"If [Muhammad] would but produce for us a miracle from his Sustainer! [But] has there not come unto them a clear evidence [of the truth of this divine writ] in what is [to be found] in the earlier scriptures?","2482":"For [thus it is:] had We destroyed them by means of a chastisement ere this [divine writ was revealed], they would indeed [be justified to] say [on Judgment Day]: \"O our Sustainer! If only Thou hadst sent an apostle unto us, we would have followed Thy messages rather than be humiliated and disgraced [in the hereafter]!\"","2483":"Say: \"Everyone is hopefully waiting [for what the future may bring]: wait, then, [for the Day of Judgment] for then you will come to know as to who has followed the even path, and who has found guidance!\"","2484":"CLOSER DRAWS unto men their reckoning: and yet they remain stubbornly heedless [of its approach].","2485":"Whenever there comes unto them any new re­minder from their Sustainer, they but listen to it with playful amusement,","2486":"their hearts set on passing ­delights; yet they who are [thus] bent on wrongdoing conceal their innermost thoughts [when they say to one another], “Is this [Muhammad] anything but a mortal like yourselves? Will you, then, yield to [his] spellbinding eloquence with your eyes open?”","2487":"Say: “My Sustainer knows whatever is spoken in heaven and on earth; and He alone is all-hearing, all-knowing.”","2488":"“Nay,” they say, “[Muhammad propounds] the most involved and confusing of dreams!” “Nay, but he has invented [all] this!” - “Nay, but he is [only] a poet!” - [and,] “Let him, then, come unto us with a miracle, just as those [prophets] of old were sent [with miracles]?”","2489":"Not one of the communities that We destroyed in bygone times would ever believe [their prophets]: will these, then, [be more willing to] believe?","2490":"For [even] before thy time, [O Muhammad,] We never sent [as Our apostles] any but [mortal] men, whom We inspired - hence, [tell the deniers of the truth,] “If you do not know this, ask the followers of earlier revelation”","2491":"and neither did We endow them with bodies that could dispense with food nor were they immortal.","2492":"In the end, We made good unto them Our promise, and We saved them and all whom We willed [to save], and We destroyed those who had wasted their own selves.","2493":"[O MEN!] We have now bestowed upon you from on high a divine writ containing all that you ought to bear in mind will you not, then, use your reason?","2494":"For, how many a community that persisted in evildoing have We dashed into fragments, and raised another people in its stead!","2495":"And [every time,] as soon as they began to feel Our punishing might, lo! they tried to flee from it","2496":"[and at the same time they seemed to hear a scornful voice]: “Do not try to flee, but return to all that [once] gave you pleasure and corrupted your whole being. and [return] to your homes, so that you might be called to account [for what you have done]!”","2497":"And they could only cry: “Oh, woe unto us! Verily, we were wrongdoers!”","2498":"And that cry of theirs did not cease until We caused them to become [like] a field mown down, still and silent as ashes.","2499":"AND [know that] We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in mere idle play:","2500":"[for,] had We willed to indulge in a pastime, We would indeed have produced it from within Ourselves - if such had been Our will at all!","2501":"Nay, but [by the very act of creation] We hurl the truth against falsehood, and it crushes the latter: and lo! it withers away. But woe unto you for all your [attempts at] defining [God] –","2502":"for, unto Him belong all [beings] that are in the heavens and on earth; and those that are with Him are never too proud to worship Him and never grow weary [thereof]:","2503":"they extol His lim­itless glory by night and by day, never flagging [therein].","2504":"And yet some people choose to worship certain earthly things or beings as deities that [are supposed to] resurrect [the dead; and they fail to realize that],","2505":"had there been in heaven or on earth any deities other than God, both [those realms would surely have fallen into ruin! But limitless in His glory is God, enthroned in His awesome almightiness far] above anything that men may devise by way of definition!","2506":"He cannot be called to account for whatever He does, whereas they will be called to account:","2507":"and yet, they choose to worship [imaginary] deities instead of Him! Say [O Prophet]: “Produce an evidence for what you are claiming: this is a reminder [unceasingly voiced] by those who are with me, just as it was a reminder [voiced] by those who came before me.” But nay, most of them do not know the truth, and so they stubbornly turn away [from it]","2508":"and [this despite the fact that even] before thy time We never sent any apostle without having revealed to him that there is no deity save Me, - [and that,] therefore, you shall worship Me [alone]!","2509":"And [yet,] some say, “The Most Gracious has taken unto Himself a son”! Limitless is He in His glory! Nay, [those whom they regard as God’s “offspring” are but His] honoured servants:","2510":"they speak not until He has spoken unto them, and [whenever they act,] they act at His behest.","2511":"He knows all that lies open before them and all that is hidden from them: hence, they cannot intercede for any but those whom He has [already] graced with His goodly acceptance, since they themselves stand in reverent awe of Him.","2512":"And if any of them were to say, “Behold, I am deity beside Him” - that one We should requite with hell: thus do We requite all [such] evildoers.","2513":"ARE, THEN, they who are bent on denying the truth not aware that the heavens and the earth were [once] one single entity, which We then parted asunder? – and [that] We made out of water every living thing? Will they not, then, [begin to] believe?","2514":"And [are they not aware that] We have set up firm mountains on earth, lest it sway with them, and [that] We have appointed thereon broad paths, so that they might find their way,","2515":"and [that] We have set up the sky as a canopy well-secured? And yet, they stubbornly turn away from [all] the signs of this [creation],","2516":"and [fail to see that] it is He who has created the night and the day and the sun and the moon - all of them floating through space!","2517":"AND [remind those who deny thee, O Prophet, that] never have We granted life everlasting to any mortal before thee: but do they, perchance, hope that al­though thou must die, they will live forever?”","2518":"Every human being is bound to taste death; and We test you [all] through the bad and the good [things of life] by way of trial: and unto Us you all must return.","2519":"But [thus it is:] whenever they who are bent on denying the truth consider thee, they make thee but a target of their mockery, [saying to one another,] “Is this the one who speaks [so contemptuously] of your gods?” and yet, it is they themselves who, at [every] mention of the Most Gracious, are wont to deny the truth!","2520":"Man is a creature of haste; [but in time] I shall make obvious to you [the truth of] My mes­sages: do not, then, ask Me to hasten [it]!","2521":"But they [who reject My messages are wont to] ask, “When is that promise [of God’s judgment] to be fulfilled? [Answer this, O you who believe in it,] if you are men of truth!”","2522":"If they but knew - they who are bent on deny­ing the truth - [that there will come] a time when they will not be able to ward off the fire from their faces, nor from their backs, and will not find any succour!","2523":"Nay, but [the Last Hour] will come upon them of a sudden, and will stupefy them: and they will be unable to avert it, and neither wilt they be allowed any respite.","2524":"And, indeed, [O Muhammad, even] before thy time have [God’s] apostles been derided - but those who scoffed at them were [in the end] overwhelmed by the very thing which they had been wont to deride.","2525":"Say: “Who could protect you, by night or by day, from the Most Gracious?” And yet, from a remembrance of their Sustainer do they stubbornly turn away!","2526":"Do they [really think that they] have deities that could shield them from Us? Those [alleged dei­ties] are not [even] able to succour themselves: hence, neither can they [who worship them hope to] be aided [by them] against Us.","2527":"Nay, We have allowed these [sinners] – as [We allowed] their forebears – to enjoy the good things of life for a great length of time: but then – have they never yet seen how We visit the earth [with Our punishment], gradually depriving it of all that is best thereon? Can they, then, [hope to] be the winners?","2528":"SAY [unto all men]: “I but warn you on the strength of divine revelation!” But the deaf [of heart] will not hearken to this call, however often they are warned.","2529":"And yet, if but a breath of thy Sustainer’s chastisement touches them, they are sure to cry, “Oh, woe unto us! Verily, we were evildoers!”","2530":"But We shall set up just balance-scales on Resurrection Day, and no human being shall be wrong­ed in the least: for though there be [in him but] the weight of a mustard-seed [of good or evil], We shall bring it forth; and none can take count as We do!","2531":"AND, INDEED, We vouchsafed unto Moses and Aaron [Our revelation as] the standard by which to discern the true from the false, and as a [guiding] light and a reminder for the God-conscious","2532":"who stand in awe of their Sustainer although He is beyond the reach of human perception, and who tremble at the thought of the Last Hour.","2533":"And [like those earlier revelations,] this one, too, is a blessed reminder which We have bestowed from on high: will you, then, disavow it?","2534":"AND, INDEED, long before [the time of Moses] We vouchsafed unto Abraham his consciousness of what is right; and We were aware of [what moved] him","2535":"when he said unto his father and his people, “What are these images to which you are so intensely devoted?”","2536":"They answered: “We found our forefathers worshipping them.”","2537":"Said he: “Indeed, you and your forefathers have obviously gone astray!”","2538":"They asked: “Hast thou come unto us [with this claim] in all earnest - or art thou one of those jesters?”","2539":"He answered: “Nay, but your [true] Sustainer is the Sustainer of the heavens and the earth - He who has brought them into being: and I am one of those who bear witness to this [truth]!”","2540":"And [he added to himself.] “By God, I shall most certainly bring about the downfall of your idols as soon as you have turned your backs and gone away!”","2541":"And then he broke those [idols] to pieces, [all] save the biggest of them, so that they might [be able to] turn to it.","2542":"[When they saw what had happened,] they said: “Who has done this to our gods? Verily, one of the worst wrongdoers is he!”","2543":"Said some [of them]: “We heard a youth speak of these [gods with scorn]: he is called Abraham.”","2544":"[The others] said: “Then bring him before the peoples eyes, so that they might bear witness [against him]!”","2545":"[And when he came.] they asked: “Hast thou done this to our gods, O Abraham?”","2546":"He answered: “Nay, it was this one, the big­gest of them, that did it: but ask them [yourselves] - provided they can speak!”","2547":"And so they turned upon one another, saying, “Behold, it is you who are doing wrong.”","2548":"But then they relapsed into their former way of thinking and said: “Thou knowest very well that these [idols] cannot speak!”","2549":"Said [Abraham]: “Do you then worship, instead of God, something that cannot benefit you in any way, nor harm you?","2550":"Fie upon you and upon all that you worship instead of God! Will you not, then, use your reason?”","2551":"They exclaimed: “Burn him, and [thereby] succour your gods, if you are going to do [anything]!”","2552":"[But] We said: O fire! Be thou cool, and [a source of] inner peace for Abraham!”","2553":"and whereas they sought to do evil unto him, We caused them to suffer the greatest loss:","2554":"for We saved him and Lot, [his brother’s son, by guiding them] to the land which We have blessed for all times to come.","2555":"And We bestowed upon him Isaac and [Isaacs son] Jacob as an additional gift and caused all of them to be righteous men,","2556":"and made them leaders who would guide [others] in accordance with Our behest: for We inspired them [with a will] to do good works, and to be constant in prayer, and to dispense charity: and Us [alone] did they worship.","2557":"AND UNTO Lot, too, We vouchsafed sound judg­ment and knowledge [of right and wrong], and saved him from that community which was given to deeds of abomination. [We destroyed those people - forr,] verily, they were people lost in evil, depraved –","2558":"whereas him We admitted unto Our grace: for, behold, he was among the righteous.","2559":"AND [remember] Noah - [how,] when He called out [unto Us], long before [the time of Abraham and Lot], We responded to him and saved him and his house­hold from that awesome calamity;","2560":"and [how] We succoured him against the people who had given the lie to Our messages: verily, they were people lost in evil - and [so] We caused them all to drown.","2561":"AND [remember] David and Solomon - [how it was] when both of them gave judgment concerning the field into which some people’s sheep had strayed by night and pastured therein, and [how] We bore witness to their judgment:","2562":"for, [though] We made Solomon understand the case [more profoundly] yet We vouchsafed unto both of them sound judgment and knowledge [of right and wrong]. And We caused the mountains to join David in extolling Our limitless glory, and likewise the birds: for We are able to do [all things].","2563":"And We taught him how to make garments [of God- consciousness] for you, [O men,] so that they might fortify you against all that may cause you fear: but are you grateful [for this boon]?","2564":"And unto Solomon [We made subservient] the stormy wind, so that it sped at his behest towards the land which We had blessed: for it is We who have knowledge of everything.","2565":"And among the rebel­lious forces [which We made subservient to him] there were some that dived for him [into the sea] and performed other works, besides: but it was We who kept watch over them.","2566":"AND [remember] Job, when he cried out to his Sus­tainer, “Affliction has befallen me: but Thou art the most merciful of the merciful!”","2567":"whereupon We responded unto him and removed all the affliction from which he suffered; and We gave him new offspring, doubling their number as an act of grace from Us, and as a reminder unto all who worship Us.","2568":"AND [remember] Ishmael and Idris and every one who [like them] has pledged himself [unto God]: they all were among those who are patient in adver­sity,","2569":"and so We admitted them unto Our grace: behold, they were among the righteous!","2570":"AND [remember] him of the great fish when he went off in wrath, thinking that We had no power over him! But then heeded out in the deep darkness [of his distress]: “There is no deity save Thee! Limit­less art Thou in Thy glory! Verily, I have done wrong!”","2571":"And so We responded unto him and delivered him from [his] distress: for thus do We deliver all who have faith.","2572":"AND [thus did We deliver] Zachariah when he cried out unto his Sustainer: “O my Sustainer! Leave me not childless! But [even if Thou grant me no bodily heir, I know that] Thou wilt remain when all else has ceased to be!”","2573":"And so We responded unto him, and bestowed upon him the gift of John, having made his wife fit to bear him a child: [and,] verily, these [three] would vie with one another in doing good works, and would call unto Us in yearning and awe; and they were always humble before Us.","2574":"AND [remember] her who guarded her chastity, whereupon We breathed into her of Our spirit and caused her, together with her son, to become a symbol [of Our grace] unto all people.","2575":"VERILY, [O you who believe in Me,] this community of yours is one single community, since I am the Sustainer of you all: worship, then, Me [alone]!","2576":"But men have torn their unity wide asunder, [forgetting that] unto Us they all are bound to return.","2577":"And yet, whoever does [the least] of righteous deeds and is a believer withal, his endeavour shall not be disowned: for, behold, We shall record it in his favour.","2578":"Hence, it has been unfailingly true of any community whom We have ever destroyed that they [were people who] would never turn back [from their sinful ways]","2579":"until such a time as Gog and Magog are let loose [upon the world] and swarm down from every corner [of the earth],","2580":"the while the true promise [of resurrection] draws close [to its fulfillment].

Be conscious of your Sustainer: for, verily the violent convulsion of the Last Hour will be an awesome thing!","2597":"On the Day when you behold it, every woman that feeds a child at her breast will utterly forget her nursling, and every woman heavy with child will bring forth her burden [before her time]; and it will seem to thee that all mankind is drunk, although they will not be drunk - but vehement will be [their dread of] God’s chastisement.","2598":"And yet, among men there is many a one who argues about God without having any knowledge [of Him], and follows every rebellious satanic force","2599":"about which it has been decreed that whoever entrusts himself to it, him will it lead astray and guide towards the suffering of the blazing flame!","2600":"O MEN! If you are in doubt as to the [truth of] resurrection, [remember that,] verily, We have created [every one of] you out of dust, then out of a drop of sperm, then out of a germ-cell, then out of an embryonic lump complete [in itself] and yet incom­plete so that We might make [your origin] clear unto you. And whatever We will [to be born] We cause to rest in the [mothers’] wombs for a term set [by Us], and then We bring you forth as infants and [allow you to live] so that [some of] you might attain to maturity: for among you are such as are caused to die [in childhood], just as many a one of you is reduced in old age to a most abject state, ceasing to know anything of what he once knew so well.

Hence, extol the name of God over them when they are lined up [for sacrifice]; and after they have fallen lifeless to the ground, eat of their flesh, and feed the poor who is contented with his lot (and does not beg), as well as him who is forced to beg. It is to this end that We have made them subservient to your needs, so that you might have cause to be grateful.","2632":"[But bear in mind:] never does their flesh reach God, and neither their blood: it is only your God-consciousness that reaches Him.

We have been taught the speech of birds, and have been given [in abundance] of all [good] things: this, behold, is indeed a manifest favour [from God]!”","3176":"And [one day] there were assembled before Solomon his hosts of invisible beings, and of men, and of birds; and then they were led forth in orderly ranks,","3177":"till, when they came upon a valley [full] of ants, an ant exclaimed: “O you ants! Get into your dwellings, lest Solomon and his hosts crush you without [even] being aware [of you]!”","3178":"Thereupon [Solomon] smiled joyously at her words, and said: “O my Sustainer! Inspire me so that I may forever be grateful for those blessings of Thine with which Thou hast graced me and my parents, and that I may do what is right [in a manner] that will please Thee; and include me, by Thy grace, among Thy righteous servants!”","3179":"And [one day] he looked in vain for [a parti­cular one of] the birds; and so he said: How is it that I do not see the hoopoe? Or could he be among the absent?","3180":"[If so,] I will punish him most severely or will kill him unless he bring me a convincing excuse!”","3181":"But [the hoopoe] tarried but a short while; and [when it came] it said: “I have encompassed [with my knowledge] something that thou hast never yet encompassed [with thine] - for I have come to thee from Sheba with a tiding sure!","3182":"“Behold, I found there a woman ruling over them; and she has been given [abundance] of all [good] things, and hers is a mighty throne,","3183":"And I found her and her people adoring the sun instead of God; and Satan has made these doings of theirs seem goodly to them, and [thus] has barred them from the path [of God], so that they cannot find the right way:","3184":"[for they have come to believe] that they ought not to adore God [although it is He] who brings forth all that is hidden in the heavens and on earth, and knows all that you would conceal as well as all that you bring into the open:","3185":"God, save whom there is no deity - the Sustainer, in awesome almightiness enthroned!”","3186":"Said [Solomon]: “We shall see whether thou hast told the truth or art one of the liars!","3187":"Go with this my letter and convey it to them; and thereafter withdraw from them and see what [answer] they return.”","3188":"[When the Queen had read Solomon’s letter,] she said: “O you nobles! A truly distinguished letter has been conveyed unto me.","3189":"Behold, it is from Solomon, and it says, ‘In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Dispenser of Grace:","3190":"[God says:] Exalt not yourselves against Me, but come unto Me in willing surrender!’”","3191":"She added: “O you nobles! Give me your opinion on the problem with which I am now faced; I would never make a [weighty] decision unless you are present with me.”","3192":"They answered: “We are endowed with power and with mighty prowess in war - but the command is thine; consider, then, what thou wouldst command.”","3193":"Said she: “Verily, whenever kings enter a country they corrupt it, and turn the noblest of its people into the most abject. And this is the way they [always] behave?","3194":"Hence, behold, I am going to send a gift to those [people], and await whatever [answer] the envoys bring back.”","3195":"Now when [the Queen’s messenger] came unto Solomon, he said: “Do you people mean to add to my wealth? But that which God has given me is [so much] better than all that He has given you! Nay, it is [only such as] you that would rejoice in this gift of yours!","3196":"“Go thou back unto them [that have sent thee]! For, [God says:] ‘We shall most certainly come upon them with forces which they will never be able to withstand, and shall most certainly cause them to be driven from that [land of theirs], despicable and humbled!’”","3197":"[When Solomon learned that the Queen of Sheba was coming,] he said [to his council]: “O you nobles! Which of you can bring me her throne ere she and her followers come unto me in willing surrender to God?”","3198":"Said a bold one of the invisible beings [subject to Solomon]: “I shall bring it to thee ere thou rise from thy council-seat - for, behold, I am powerful enough to do it, [and] worthy of trust!”","3199":"Answered he who was illumined by revela­tion: “[Nay,] as for me - I shall bring it to thee ere the twinkling of thy eye ceases!” And when he saw it truly before him, he exclaimed: “This is [an outcome] of my Sustainer’s bounty, to test me as to whether I am grateful or ungrateful! However, he who is grateful [to God] is but grateful for his own good; and he who is ungrate­ful [should know that], verily, my Sustainer is self-sufficient, most generous in giving!”","3200":"[And] he continued: Alter her throne so that she may not know it as hers: let us see whether she allows herself to be guided [to the truth] or remains one of those who will not be guided.”","3201":"And so, as soon as she arrived, she was asked: “Is thy throne like this?” She answered: “It is as though it were the same!” [And Solomon said to his nobles: “She has arrived at the truth without any help from us,] although it is we who have been given [divine] knowledge before her, and have [long ago] surrendered ourselves unto God!","3202":"[And she has recognized the truth] although that which she has been wont to worship instead of God had kept her away [from the right path]: for, behold, she is descended of people who deny the truth!”","3203":"[After a while] she was told: “Enter this court!” - but when she saw it, she thought that it was a fathomless expanse of water, and she bared her legs. Said he: “Behold, it is [but] a court smoothly paved with glass!” Cried she: “O my Sustainer! I have been sinning against myself thy worshipping aught but Thee]: but [now] I have surrendered myself, with Solomon, unto the Sustainer of all the worlds!”","3204":"AND [likewise], indeed, We sent unto [the tribe of] Thamud their brother Salih [with this message]: “Worship God alone!” and, behold, they were [split into] two factions contending with one another.","3205":"Said [Salih to the erring ones]: Why do you seek to hasten the coming upon you of evil instead of hoping for the good?” Why do you not, rather, ask God to forgive you your sins, so that you might be graced with His mercy?”","3206":"They answered: “We augur evil from thee and those that follow thee!” Said he: “Your destiny, good or evil, rests with God yea, you are people undergoing a test!”","3207":"Now there were in the city nine men who were wont to commit deeds of depravity all over the land, and would not reform;","3208":"[and] after having bound one another by an oath in God’s name, they said: “Indeed, we shall suddenly fall upon him and his household by night [and slay them all]; and then we shall boldly say to his next of kin, ‘We did not witness the destruction of his household - and, behold, we are indeed men of truth!’”","3209":"And so they devised an evil scheme; but We devised a subtle scheme (of Our own), and they perceived it not.","3210":"Behold, then, what all their scheming came to in the end: We utterly destroyed them and their people, all of them;","3211":"and [now] those dwellings of theirs are empty, [ruined] as an outcome of their evil deeds. In this, behold, there is a message indeed for peo­ple of [innate] knowledge –","3212":"seeing that We saved those who had attained to faith and were conscious of Us,","3213":"AND [thus, too, did We save] Lot, when he said unto his people: “Would you commit this abomination with your eyes open (to its being against all nature)?","3214":"Must you really approach men with lust instead of women? Nay, but you are people without any awareness (of right and wrong)!”","3215":"But his people’s only answer was this: “Expel [Lot and] Lot’s followers from your township! Verily, they are folk who make themselves out to be pure!”","3216":"Thereupon We saved him and his household - all but his wife, whom We willed to be among those that stayed behind -","3217":"the while We rained a rain [of destruction] upon the others: and dire is such rain upon all who let themselves be warned [to no avail]","3218":"SAY: “All praise is due to God, and peace be upon those servants of His whom He chose [to be His message-bearers]!” Is not God far better than anything to which men [falsely] ascribe a share in His divinity?","3219":"Nay - who is it that has created the heavens and the earth, and sends down for you [life-giving] water from the skies? For it is by this means that We cause gardens of shining beauty to grow - [whereas] it is not in your power to cause [even one single of] its trees to grow! Could there be any divine power besides God? Nay, they [who think so] are people who swerve [from the path of reason]","3220":"Nay - who is it that has made the earth a fitting abode [for living things], and has caused running waters [to flow] in its midst, and has set upon it moun­tains firm, and has placed a barrier between the two great bodies of water? Could there be any divine power besides God? Nay, most of those [who think so] do not know [what they are saying]!","3221":"Nay - who is it that responds to the distressed when he calls out to Him, and who removes the ill [that caused the distress], and has made you inherit the earth? Could there be any divine power besides God? How seldom do you keep this in mind!","3222":"Nay - who is it that guides you in the midst of the deep darkness of land and sea, and sends forth the winds as a glad tiding of His coming grace? Could there be any divine power besides God? Sublimely exalted is God above anything to which men may ascribe a share in His divinity!","3223":"Nay - who is it that creates [all life] in the first instance, and then brings it forth anew? And who is it that provides you with sustenance out of heaven and earth? Could there be any divine power besides God? Say: “[If you think so,] produce your evidence - if you truly believe in your claim!”","3224":"Say: “None in the heavens or on earth knows the hidden reality [of anything that exists: none knows it] save God.” And neither can they [who are living] perceive when they shall be raised from the dead:","3225":"nay, their knowledge of the life to come stops short of the truth: nay, they are [often] in doubt as to its reality: nay, they are blind to it.","3226":"And so, they who are bent on denying the truth are saying: “What! After we have become dust - we and our forefathers - shall we [all], forsooth, be brought forth [from the dead]?","3227":"Indeed, we were promised this - we and our forefathers - in the past as well; it is nothing but fables of ancient times!”","3228":"Say: “Go all over the earth and behold what happened in the end to those [who were thus] lost in sin!”","3229":"But do not grieve over them, and neither be distressed by the false arguments which they devise [against Gods messages].","3230":"And [when] they ask, “When is this promise [of resurrection] to be fulfilled? [Answer this, O you who believe in it,] if you are men of truth!” –","3231":"say thou: “It may well be that something of that which [in your ignorance] you so hastily demands has already drawn close unto you.”","3232":"Now, verily, thy Sustainer is indeed limitless in His bounty unto men - but most of them are bereft of gratitude.","3233":"But, verily, thy Sustainer knows all that their hearts conceal as well as all that they bring into the open:","3234":"for there is nothing [so deeply] hidden in the heavens or on earth but is recorded in [His] clear decree.","3235":"BEHOLD, this Qur’an explains to the children of Israel most [of that] whereon they hold divergent views;","3236":"and, verily, it is a guidance and a grace unto all who believe [in it].","3237":"Verily, [O believer,] thy Sustainer will judge between them in His wisdom - for He alone is almighty, all-knowing.","3238":"Hence, place thy trust in God [alone] - for, behold, that in which thou believest is truth self-evident.","3239":"[But,] verily, thou canst not make the dead hear: and [so, too,] thou canst not make the deaf [of heart] hear this call when they turn their backs [on thee] and go away,","3240":"just as thou canst not lead the blind [of heart] out of their error; none canst thou make hear save such as [are willing to] believe in Our messages, and thus surrender themselves unto Us.","3241":"Now, [as for the deaf and blind of heart –] when the word [of truth] stands revealed against them, We shall bring forth unto them out of the earth a creature, which will tell them that mankind had no real faith in Our messages.","3242":"And on that Day We shall gather from within every community a host of those who gave the lie to Our messages; and they will be grouped [according to the gravity of their sins]","3243":"until such a time as they shall come [to be judged. And] He will say: “Did you give the lie to My messages even though you failed to encompass them with [your] knowledge? Or what was it that [you thought] you were doing?”","3244":"And the word [of truth] will stand revealed against them in the face of all the wrong which they had committed, and they will not [be able to] utter a single word [of excuse]:","3245":"for, were they not aware that it is We who had made the night for them, so that they might rest therein, and the day, to make [them] see? In this, behold, there are messages indeed for peo­ple who will believe!","3246":"And on that Day the trumpet [of judgment] will be sounded, and all [creatures] that are in the heavens and all that are on earth will be stricken with terror, except such as God wills [to exempt]: and in utter lowliness all will come unto Him.","3247":"And thou wilt see the mountains, which [now] thou deemest so firm, pass away as clouds pass away: a work of God, who has ordered all things to per­fection! Verily, He is fully aware of all that you do!","3248":"Whoever shall come [before Him] with a good deed will gain [further] good there from; and they will be secure from the terror of that Day.","3249":"But they who shall come with evil deeds – their faces will be thrust into the fire, [and they will be asked:] “Is this aught but a just requital for what you were doing [in life]?”","3250":"[SAY, O Muhammad:] “I have been bidden to worship the Sustainer of this City – Him who has made it sacred, and unto whom all things belong: and I have been bidden to be of those who surrender themselves to Him,","3251":"and to convey this Qur’an [to the world].” Whoever, therefore, chooses to follow the right path, follows it but for his own good; and if any wills to go astray, say [unto him]: “I am only a warner.","3252":"And say: “All praise is due to God! In time He will make you see [the truth of] His messages, and then you shall know them [for what they are].” And thy Sustainer is not unmindful of whatever you all may do.","3253":"Ta. Sin. Mim.","3254":"These are messages of a divine writ clear in itself and clearly showing the truth.","3255":"We [now] convey unto thee some of the story of Moses and Pharaoh, setting forth the truth for [the benefit of] people who will believe.","3256":"Behold, Pharaoh exalted himself in the land and divided its people into castes. One group of them he deemed utterly low; he would slaughter their sons and spare (only) their women: for, behold, he was one of those who spread corruption [on earth].","3257":"But it was Our will to bestow Our favour upon those [very people] who were deemed [so] utterly low in the land, and to make them forerunners in faith. and to make them heirs [to Pharaoh’s glory],","3258":"and to establish them securely on earth, and to let Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts experience through those [children of Israel] the very thing against which they sought to protect themselves.","3259":"And so, [when he was born,] We inspired [thus] the mother of Moses: Suckle him [for a time], and then, when thou hast cause to fear for him, cast him into the river, and have no fear and do not grieve - for We shall restore him to thee, and shall make him one of Our message-bearers!”","3260":"And [some of] Pharaoh’s household found [and spared] him: for [We had willed] that he becomes an enemy unto them and [a source of] grief, seeing that Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts were sinners indeed!","3261":"Now the wife of Pharaoh said: “A joy to the eye [could this child be] for me and thee! Slay him not: he may well be of use to us, or we may adopt him as a son!” And they had no presentiment [of what he was to become].","3262":"On the morrow, however, an aching void grew up in the heart of the mother of Moses, and she would indeed have disclosed all about him had We not endowed her heart with enough strength to keep alive her faith [in Our promise].","3263":"And so she said to his sister, “Follow him” - and [the girl] watched him from afar, while they [who had taken him in] were not aware of it,","3264":"Now from the very beginning We caused him to refuse the breast of [Egyptian] nurses; and [when his sister came to know this,] she said: “Shall I guide you to a family that might rear him for you, and look after him with good will?”","3265":"And thus We restored him to his mother, so that her eye might he gladdened, and that she might grieve no longer, and that she might know that God’s promise always comes true - even though most of them know it not!","3266":"Now when [Moses] reached full manhood and had become mature [of mind]. We bestowed upon him the ability to judge [between right and wrong] as well as [innate] knowledge: for thus do We reward the doers of good.","3267":"And [one day] he entered the city at a time when [most of] its people were [resting in their houses,] unaware of what was going on [in the streets]; and there he encountered two men fighting with one another - one of his own people, and the other of his enemies. And the one who belonged to his own people cried out to him for help against him who was of his enemies - whereupon Moses struck him down with his fist, and [thus] brought about his end. [But then] he said [to himself]: “This is of Satan’s doing! Verily, he is an open foe, leading [man] astray!”","3268":"[And] he prayed: O my Sustainer! Verily, I have sinned against myself! Grant me, then, Thy forgiveness!” And He forgave him - for, verily, He alone is truly forgiving, a dispenser of grace.","3269":"Said he: “O my Sustainer! [I vow] by all the blessings which Thou hast bestowed on me: Never­more shall I aid such as are lost in sin!”","3270":"And next morning he found himself in the city, looking fearfully about him, when lo! the one who had sought his help the day before [once again] cried out to him [for help whereupon] Moses said unto him: “Behold, thou art indeed, most clearly, deeply in the wrong!","3271":"But then as soon as he was about to lay violent hands on the man who was their [common] enemy, the latter exclaimed: “O Moses, dost thou intend to slay me as thou didst slay another man yesterday? Thy sole aim is to become a tyrant in this land, for thou dost not care to be of those who would set things to rights!”","3272":"And [then and there] a man came running from the farthermost end of the city, and said: “O Moses! Behold, the great ones [of the kingdom] are deli­berating upon thy case with a view to killing thee! Begone, then: verily, I am of those who wish thee well!”","3273":"So he went forth from thence, looking fearfully about him, and prayed: “O my Sustainer! Save me from all evildoing folk!”","3274":"And as he turned his face towards Madyan, he said [to himself]: “It may well be that my Sustainer will [thus] guide me onto the right path”","3275":"NOW WHEN he arrived at the wells of Madyan, he found there a large group of men who were watering [their herds and flocks]; and at some distance from them he came upon two women who were keeping back their flock. He asked [them]: “What is the matter with you?” They answered: “We cannot water [our animals] until the herdsmen drive [theirs] home - for [we are weak and] our father is a very old man.”","3276":"So he watered [their flock] for them: and when he withdrew into the shade and prayed: “O my Sus­tainer! Verily, in dire need am I of any good which Thou mayest bestow upon me!”","3277":"[Shortly] afterwards, one of the two [maidens] approached him, walking shyly, and said: “Behold, my father invites thee, so that he might duly reward thee for thy having watered [our flock] for us.” And as soon as [Moses] came unto him and told him the story [of his life], he said: “Have no fear! Thou art now safe from those evildoing folk!”","3278":"Said one of the two [daughters]: “O my father! Hire him: for, behold, the best [man] that thou couldst hire is one who is [as] strong and worthy of trust [as he]!”","3279":"[After some time, the father] said: “Behold, I am willing to let thee wed one of these two daughters of mine on the understanding that thou wilt remain eight years in my service; and if thou shouldst com­plete ten [years], that would be [an act of grace] from thee, for I do not want to impose any hardship on thee: [on the contrary,] thou wilt find me, if God so wills, righteous in all my dealings.”","3280":"Answered [Moses]: “Thus shall it be between me and thee! Whichever of the two terms I fulfill, let there be no ill will against me. And God be witness to all that we say!”","3281":"And when Moses had fulfilled his term and was wandering with his family [in the desert], he per­ceived a fire on the slope of Mount Sinai; [and so] he said to his family: “Wait here. Behold, I perceive a fire [far away]; perhaps I may bring you from there some tiding, or [at least] a burning brand from the fire, so that you might warm yourselves.","3282":"But when he came close to it, a call was sounded from the right-side bank of the valley, out of the tree [burning] on blessed ground: “O Moses! Verily, I am God, the Sustainer of all the worlds!”","3283":"And [then He said]: “Throw down thy staff!” But as soon as [Moses] saw it move rapidly, as if it were a snake, he drew back [in terror], and did not [dare to] return. [And God spoke to him again:] “O Moses! Draw near, and have no fear - for, behold, thou art of those who are secure [in this world and in the next]!","3284":"“[And now] put thy hand into thy bosom: it will come forth [shining] white, without blemish. And [henceforth] hold thine arm close to thyself, free of all fear. “These, then, shall be the two signs [of thy bearing a message] from thy Sustainer unto Pharaoh and his great ones - for, behold, they are people depraved!”","3285":"Said [Moses] “O my Sustainer! I have slain one of them, and so I fear that they will slay me.","3286":"And my brother Aaron - he is far better in speech than I am. Send him, therefore, as a helper, so that he might [more eloquently] bear witness to my speaking the truth: for I fear indeed that they will give me the lie.”","3287":"Said He: “We shall strengthen thine arm through thy brother, and endow both of you with power, so that they will not be able to touch you: by virtue of Our messages shall you two, and all who follow you, prevail!”","3288":"But as soon as Moses came unto them with Our clear messages [Pharaoh and his great ones] said: “All this is nothing but spellbinding eloquence devised [by man]: and never did we hear [the like of] this, [nor has it ever been heard of] in the time of our forebears of old!”","3289":"And Moses replied: “My Sustainer knows best as to who comes with guidance from Him, and to whom the future belongs! Verily, never will evil­doers attain to a happy state!”","3290":"Whereupon Pharaoh said: “O you nobles! I did not know that you could have any deity other than myself Well, then, O Haman, kindle me a fire for [baking bricks of] clay, and then build me a lofty tower, that haply I may have a look at the god of Moses although, behold, I am convinced that he is of those who [always] tell lies!”","3291":"Thus arrogantly, without the least good sense, did he and his hosts behave on earth - just as if they thought that they would never have to appear before Us [for judgment]!","3292":"And so We seized him and his hosts and cast them into the sea: and behold what happened in the end to those evildoers:","3293":"[We destroyed them,] and We set them up as archetypes [of evil] that show the way to the fire [of hell]; and [whereas] no succour will come to them on Resurrection Day,","3294":"We have caused a curse to follow them in this world as well; and on Resurrection Day they will find themselves among those who are bereft of all good.","3295":"And [then,] indeed, after We had destroyed those earlier generations [of sinners], We vouchsafed unto Moses [Our] revelation as a means of insight for men, and as a guidance and grace, so that they might bethink themselves [of Us].","3296":"NOW [as for thee, O Muhammad,] thou wert not present on the sunset slope [of Mount Sinai] when We imposed the Law upon Moses, nor wert thou among those who witnessed [his times]:","3297":"nay, but [between them and thee] We brought into being [many] generations, and long was their span of life. And neither didst thou dwell among the people of Madyan, conveying Our messages unto them: nay, but We have [always] been sending [Our message-bearers unto man].","3298":"And neither wert thou present on the slope of Mount Sinai when We called out [to Moses]: but [thou, too, art sent] as an act of thy Sustainer’s grace, to warn people to whom no warner has come before thee, so that they might bethink themselves [of Us];","3299":"and [We have sent thee] lest they say [on Judg­ment Day], when disaster befalls them as an outcome of what their own hands have wrought, “O our Sus­tainer, if only Thou had sent an apostle unto us, we would have followed Thy messages, and would have been among those who believe!”","3300":"And yet, now that the truth has come unto them from Us, they say, “Why has he not been vouch­safed the like of what Moses was vouchsafed?” But did they not also, before this, deny the truth of what Moses was vouchsafed? [For] they do say, “Two examples of delusion, [seemingly] supporting each other!” And they add, “Behold, we refuse to accept either of them as true!”","3301":"Say: “Produce, then, [another] revelation from God which would offer better guidance than either of these two [and] I shall follow it, if you speak the truth!”","3302":"And since they cannot respond to this thy challenge, know that they are following only their own likes and dislikes: and who could be more astray than he who follows [but] his own likes and dislikes without any guidance from God? Verily, God does not grace with His guidance peo­ple who are given to evildoing!","3303":"NOW, INDEED, We have caused this word [of Ours] to reach mankind step by step, so that they might [learn to] keep it in mind.","3304":"As for those unto whom We have vouchsafed revelation aforetime - they [are bound to] believe in this one [as well];","3305":"and whenever it is [clearly] conveyed unto them, they [are bound to] profess, “We have come to believe in it, for, behold, it is the truth from our Sustainer - and, verily, even before this have we surrendered ourselves unto Him!”","3306":"These it is that shall receive a twofold reward for having been patient in adversity, and having repelled evil with good, and having spent on others out of what We provided for them as sus­tenance,","3307":"and, whenever they heard frivolous talk, having turned away from it and said: “Unto us shall be accounted Our deeds, and unto you, your deeds. Peace be upon you - [but] we do not seek out such as are ignorant [of the meaning of right and wrong].”","3308":"VERILY, thou canst not guide aright everyone whom thou lovest: but it is God who guides him that wills [to be guided]; and He is fully aware of all who would let themselves be guided.","3309":"Now some say, “If we were to follow the guidance to which thou invitest us, we would be torn away from our very soil!” Why - have We not established for them a sanc­tuary secure, to which, as a provision from Us, shall be gathered the fruits of all (good) things? But most of them are unaware [of this truth].","3310":"And how many a community that [once] exult­ed in its wanton wealth and ease of life have We destroyed, so that those dwelling-places of theirs – all but a few - have never been dwelt-in after them: for it is indeed We alone who shall remain when all else will have passed away!","3311":"Yet, withal, thy Sustainer would never destroy a community without having [first] raised in its midst an apostle who would convey unto them Our mes­sages; and never would We destroy a community unless its people are wont to do wrong [to one another].","3312":"And [remember:] whatever you are given [now] is but for the [passing] enjoyment of life in this world, and for its embellishment - whereas that which is with God is [so much] better and more enduring.

Do not enter the Prophet’s dwellings unless you are given leave; [and when invited] to a meal, do not come [so early as] to wait for it to be readied: but whenever you are invited, enter [at the proper time]; and when you have partaken of the meal, disperse without lingering for the sake of mere talk: that, behold, might give offence to the Prophet, and yet he might feel shy of [asking] you [to leave]: but God is not shy of [teaching you] what is right. And [as for the Prophet’s wives,] whenever you ask them for anything that you need, ask them from behind a screen: this will but deepen the purity of your hearts and theirs. Moreover, it does not behove you to give offence to God’s Apostle - just as it would not behove you ever to marry his widows after he has passed away: that, verily, would be an enormity in the sight of God.","3587":"Whether you do anything openly or in secret, [remember that,] verily, God has full knowledge of everything.","3588":"[However,] it is no sin for them [to appear freely] before their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their brothers’ sons, or their sisters’ sons, or their womenfolk, or such [male slaves] as their right hands may possess. But [always, O wives of the Prophet,] remain con­scious of God - for, behold, God is witness unto everything.","3589":"Verily, God and His angels bless the Prophet: [hence,] O you who have attained to faith, bless him and give yourselves up [to his guidance] in utter self-surrender!","3590":"Verily, as for those who [knowingly] affront God and His Apostle - God will reject them in this world and in the life to come; and shameful suffering will He ready for them.","3591":"And as for those who malign believing men and believing women without their having done any wrong - they surely burden themselves with the guilt of calumny, and [thus] with a flagrant sin!","3592":"O Prophet! Tell thy wives and thy daughters, as well as all [other] believing women, that they should draw over themselves some of their outer garments [when in public]: this will be more con­ducive to their being recognized [as decent women] and not annoyed. But [withal,] God is indeed much- forgiving, a dispenser of grace!","3593":"THUS IT IS: if the hypocrites, and they in whose hearts is disease, and they who, by spreading false rumours, would cause disturbances in the City [of the Prophet] desist not [from their hostile doings]. We shall indeed give thee mastery over them, [O Muhammad] - and then they will not remain thy neighbours in this [city] for more than a little while:","3594":"bereft of God’s grace, they shall be seized wherever they may be found, and slain one and all.","3595":"Such has been God’s way with those who [sinned in like manner and] passed away aforetime - and never wilt thou find any change in God’s way!","3596":"PEOPLE will ask thee about the Last Hour. Say: “Knowledge thereof rests with God alone; yet for all thou knowest, the Last Hour may well be near!”","3597":"Verily, God has rejected the deniers of the truth, and has readied for them a blazing fire,","3598":"therein to abide beyond the count of time: no protec­tor will they find, and none to bring them succour.","3599":"On the Day when their faces shall be tossed about in the fire, they will exclaim, “Oh, would that we had paid heed unto God, and paid heed unto the Apostle!”","3600":"And they will say: “O our Sustainer! Behold, we paid heed unto our leaders and our great men, and it is they who have led us astray from the right path!","3601":"O our Sustainer! Give them double suffering, and banish them utterly from Thy grace!”","3602":"O YOU who have attained to faith! Be not like those [children of Israel] who gave offence to Moses, and [remember that] God showed him to be innocent of whatever they alleged [against him or demanded of him]: for of great honour was he in the sight of God.","3603":"O you who have attained to faith! Remain conscious of God, and [always] speak with a will to bring out [only] what is just and true -","3604":"[whereupon] He will cause your deeds to be virtuous, and will forgive you your sins. And [know that] whoever pays heed unto God and His Apostle has already attained to a mighty triumph.","3605":"Verily, We did offer the trust [of reason and volition] to the heavens, and the earth, and the mountains: but they refused to bear it because they were afraid of it. Yet man took it up - for, verily, he has always been prone to be most wicked, most foolish.","3606":"[And so it is] that God imposes suffering on the hypocrites, both men and women, as well as on the men and women who ascribe divinity to aught beside Him. And [so, too, it is] that God turns in His mercy unto the believing men and believing women: for God is indeed much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace!","3607":"ALL PRAISE is due to God, to whom all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth belongs; and to Him will be due all praise in the life to come. For He alone is truly wise, all-aware:","3608":"He knows all that enters the earth, and all that comes out of it, as well as all that descends from the skies, and all that ascends to them. And He alone is a dispenser of grace, truly-forgiving.","3609":"And yet, they who are bent on denying the truth assert, “Never will the Last Hour come upon us!” Say: “Nay, by my Sustainer! By Him who knows all that is beyond the reach of a created being’s perception: it will most certainly come upon you!” Not an atom’s weight [of whatever there is] in the heavens or on earth escapes His knowledge; and neither is there anything smaller than that, or larger, but is recorded in [His] clear decree,","3610":"to the end that He may reward those who believe and do right­eous deeds: [for] it is they whom forgiveness of sins awaits, and a most excellent sustenance","3611":"whereas for those who strive against Our messages, seeking to defeat their purpose, there is grievous suffering in store as an outcome of [their] vileness.","3612":"NOW THEY who are endowed with [innate] knowl­edge are well aware that whatever has been be­stowed upon thee from on high by thy Sustainer is indeed the truth, and that it guides onto the way that leads to the Almighty, the One to whom all praise is due!","3613":"As against this, they who are bent on denying the truth say [unto all who are of like mind]: “Shall we point out to you a man who will tell you that [after your death,] when you will have been scattered in countless fragments, you shall - lo and behold! - be [restored to life] in a new act of creation?","3614":"Does he [knowingly] attribute his own lying inventions to God - or is he a madman?” Nay, [there is no madness in this Prophet -] but they who will not believe in the life to come are [bound to lose themselves] in suffering and in a profound aberration.","3615":"Are they, then, not aware of how little of the sky and the earth lies open before them, and how much is hidden from them? [or that,] if We so willed, We could cause the earth to swallow them, or cause fragments of the sky to fall down upon them? In all this, behold, there is a message indeed for every servant [of God] who is wont to turn unto Him [in repentance].","3616":"AND [thus], indeed, did We grace David with Our favour: “O you mountains! Sing with him the praise of God! And [likewise] you birds!” And We softened all sharpness in him,","3617":"[and inspired him thus:] “Do good deeds lavishly, without stint, and give deep thought to their steady flow.” And [thus should you all, O believers,] do righteous deeds: for, verily, I see all that you do!","3618":"AND UNTO Solomon [We made subservient] the wind: its morning course [covered the distance of] a month’s journey, and its evening course, a month’s journey. And We caused a fountain of molten copper to flow at his behest; and [even] among the invisible beings there were some that had [been constrained] to labour for him by his Sustainer’s leave and whichever of them deviated from Our command, him would We let taste suffering through a blazing flame -:","3619":"they made for him whatever he wished of sanctuaries, and statues, and basins as [large as] great watering - troughs, and cauldrons firmly anchored. [And We said:] “Labour, O David’s people, in gratitude [towards Me] and [remember that] few are the truly grateful [even] among My servants!”","3620":"Yet [even Solomon had to die; but] when We decreed that he should die, nothing showed them that he was dead except an earthworm that gnawed away his staff. And when he fell to the ground, those invisible beings [subservient to him] saw clearly that, had they but understood the reality which was be­yond the reach of their perception, they would not have continued [to toil] in the shameful suffering [of servitude]","3621":"INDEED, in [the luxuriant beauty of] their homeland, the people of Sheba had an evidence [of God’s grace] two [vast expanses of] gardens, to the right and to the left, [calling out to them, as it were:] “Eat of what your Sustainer has provided for you, and render thanks unto Him: a land most goodly, and a Sustainer much-forgiving!”","3622":"But they turned away [from Us], and so We let loose upon them a flood that overwhelmed the dams, and changed their two [expanses of luxuriant] gardens into a couple of gardens yielding bitter fruit, and tamarisks, and some few [wild] lote-trees:","3623":"thus We requited them for their having denied the truth. But do We ever requite [thus] any but the utterly ingrate?","3624":"Now [before their downfall,] We had placed between them and the cities which We had blessed [many] towns within sight of one another; and thus We had made traveling easy [for them, as if to say]: “Travel safely in this [land], by night or by day!”","3625":"But now they would say, “Long has our Sus­tainer made the distance between our journey- stages!” - for they had sinned against themselves. And in the end We caused them to become [one of those] tales [of things long past], and scattered them in countless fragments. Herein, behold, there are messages indeed for all who are wholly patient in adversity and deeply grate­ful [to God].","3626":"Now, indeed, Iblis did prove that his opinion of them had been right: for [when he called them,] they followed him - all but some of the believers [among them].","3627":"And yet, he had no power at all over them: [for if We allow him to tempt man,] it is only to the end that We might make a clear distinction between those who [truly] believe in the life to come and those who are in doubt thereof: for thy Sustainer watches over all things.","3628":"SAY: “Call upon those [beings] whom you imagine [to be endowed with divine powers] beside God: they have not an atom’s weight of power either in the heavens or on earth, nor have they any share in [governing] either, nor does He [choose to] have any helper from among them.”","3629":"And, before Him, intercession can be of no avail [to any] save one in whose case He may have granted leave [there for]: so much so that when the terror [of the Last Hour] is lifted from their hearts, they [who have been resurrected] will ask [one an­other], “What has your Sustainer decreed [for you]?” - [to which] the others will answer, “Whatever is true and deserved - for He alone is exalted, great!”","3630":"Say: “Who is it that provides for you sus­tenance out of the heavens and the earth?” Say: “It is God.

Nay - nay, but He [alone] is God, the Almighty, the Wise!”","3634":"NOW [as for thee, O Muhammad,] We have not sent thee otherwise than to mankind at large, to be a herald of glad tidings and a warner; but most people do not understand [this],","3635":"and so they ask, “When is this promise [of resurrection and judgment] to be fulfilled? [Answer this, O you who believe in it,] if you are men of truth!”","3636":"Say: “There has been appointed for you a Day, which you can neither delay nor advance by a single moment.”","3637":"And [yet,] those who are bent on denying the truth do say, “We shall never believe in this Qur’an, and neither in whatever there still remains of earlier revelations!” But if thou couldst only see [how it will be on Judgment Day,] when these evildoers shall be made to stand before their Sustainer, hurling reproaches back and forth at one another! Those [of them] who had been weak [on earth] will say unto those who had gloried in their arrogance: “Had it not been for you, we would certainly have been believers!”","3638":"[And] those who were wont to glory in their arrogance will say unto those who had been weak: “Why - did we keep you [forcibly] from following the right path after it had become obvious to you? Nay, it was but you [yourselves] who were guilty!”","3639":"But those who had been weak will say unto those who had gloried in their arrogance: “Nay, [what kept us away was your] devising of false arguments, night and day, [against God’s messages- as you did] when you persuaded us to blaspheme against God and to claim that there are powers that could rival Him!” And when they see the suffering [that awaits them], they will [all] be unable to express [the full depth of] their remorse: for We shall have put shackles around the necks of those who had been bent on denying the truth: [and] will this be aught but a [just] requital for what they were doing?","3640":"For [thus it is:] whenever We sent a warner to any community, those of its people who had lost themselves entirely in the pursuit of pleasures would declare, “Behold, we deny that there is any truth in [what you claim to be] your message!” –","3641":"and they would add, “Richer [than you] are we in wealth and in children, and [so] we are not going to be made to suffer!”","3642":"Say: “Behold, my Sustainer grants abundant sustenance, or gives it in scant measure, unto whomever He wills: but most men do not understand [God’s ways].”","3643":"For, it is neither your riches nor your children that can bring you nearer to Us: only he who attains to faith and does what is right and just [comes near unto Us]; and it is [such as] these whom multiple recompense awaits for all that they have done; and it is they who shall dwell secure in the mansions [of paradise] –","3644":"whereas all who strive against Our messages, seeking to defeat their purpose, shall be given over to suffering.","3645":"Say: “Behold, my Sustainer grants abundant sustenance, or gives it in scant measure, unto whomever He wills of His servants; and whatever it be that you spend on others, He [always] replaces it: for He is the best of providers.”","3646":"And [as for those who now deny the truth,] one Day He will gather them all together, and will ask the angels, “Was it you that they were wont to worship?”","3647":"They will answer: “Limitless art Thou in Thy glory! Thou [alone] art close unto us, not they! Nay, [when they thought that they were worshipping us,] they were but [blindly] worshipping forces concealed from their senses; most of them believed in them.”","3648":"And [on that Day God will say]: “None of you [created beings] has today any power to benefit or to harm another!” And [then] We shall say unto those who had been bent on evildoing: “Taste [now] that suffering through fire which you were wont to call a lie!”","3649":"For [thus it is:] whenever Our messages are conveyed unto them in all their clarity, they [who are bent on denying the truth] say [to one another], “This [Muhammad] is nothing but a man who wants to turn you away from what your forefathers were wont to worship!” And they say, “This [Qur’an] is nothing but a falsehood invented [by man]!” And [finally,] they who are bent on denying the truth speak thus of the truth when it comes to them: “This is clearly nothing but spellbinding eloquence!”","3650":"And yet, [O Muhammad,] never have We vouchsafed them any revelations which they could quote, and neither have We sent unto them any warner before thee.","3651":"Thus, too, gave the lie to the truth [many of] those who lived before them; and although those [earlier people] had not attained to even a tenth of [the evidence of the truth] which We have vouch­safed unto these [late successors of theirs], yet when they gave the lie to My apostles, how awesome was My rejection!","3652":"Say: “I counsel you one thing only: Be [ever­ conscious of] standing before God, whether you are in the company of others or alone; and then bethink yourselves [that] there is no madness in [this pro­phet,] your fellow-man: he is only a warner to you of suffering severe to come.”","3653":"Say: “No reward have I ever asked of you [out of anything] that is yours: my reward rests with none but God, and He is witness unto everything!”","3654":"Say: “Verily, my Sustainer hurls the truth [against all that is false] He who fully knows all the things that are beyond the reach of a created being’s perception!”","3655":"Say: “The truth has now come [to light, and falsehood is bound to wither away]: for, falsehood cannot bring forth anything new, nor can it bring back [what has passed away].”","3656":"Say: “Were I to go astray, I would but go astray [due to my own self, and] to the hurt of myself; but if I am on the right path, it is but by virtue of what my Sustainer reveals unto me: for, verily, He is all-hearing, ever-near!”","3657":"IF THOU couldst but see [how the deniers of the truth will fare on Resurrection Day,] when they will shrink in terror, with nowhere to escape - since they will have been seized from so close nearby","3658":"and will cry, “We do [now] believe in it!” But how can they [hope to] attain [to salvation] from so far away,","3659":"seeing that aforetime they had been bent on denying the truth, and had been wont to cast scorn, from far away, on something that was beyond the reach of human perception?","3660":"And so, a barrier will be set between them and all that they had [ever] desired, as will be done to such of their kind as lived before their time: for, behold, they [too] were lost in doubt amounting to suspicion.","3661":"ALL PRAISE is due to God, Originator of the heavens and the earth, who causes the angels to be (His) message-bearers, endowed with wings, two, or three, or four.

Verily, God’s promise [of resurrection] is true indeed: let not, then, the life of this world delude you, and let not [your own] deceptive thoughts about God delude you!","3666":"Behold, Satan is a foe unto you: so treat him as a foe. He but calls on his followers to the end that they might find themselves among such as are des­tined for the blazing flame –","3667":"[seeing that] for those who are bent on denying the truth there is suffering severe in store, just as for those who have attained to faith and do righteous deeds there is forgiveness of sins, and a great reward.","3668":"Is, then, he to whom the evil of his own doings is [so] alluring that [in the end] he regards it as good [anything but a follower of Satan]?

It is nothing but [a mortal man’s] invention!","3978":"What! Upon him alone from among all of us should a [divine] reminder have been bestowed from on high?” Nay, but it is My Own reminder that they distrust! Nay, they have not yet tasted the suffering which I do impose!","3979":"Or do they [think that they] own the treasures of thy Sustainer’s grace - [the grace] of the Almighty, the Giver of Gifts?","3980":"Or [that] the dominion over the heavens and the earth and all that is between them is theirs? Why, then, let them try to ascend [to God-like power] by all [conceivable] means!","3981":"[But] there it is: any and all human beings, however [strongly] leagued together, are bound to suffer defeat [whenever they refuse to accept the truth].","3982":"To the truth gave the lie aforetime Noah’s people, and [the tribe of] Ad, and Pharaoh of the [many] tent-poles,","3983":"and [the tribe of] Thamud, and the people of Lot, and the dwellers of the wooded dales [of Madyan]: they all were leagued together, [as it were, in their unbelief:]","3984":"not one [was there] but gave the lie to the apostles - and thereupon My retribution fell due.","3985":"And they [who now deny the truth - they, too,] have but to wait for one single blast [of punishment to overtake them]: it shall not be delayed a whit.","3986":"As it is, they say [mockingly]: “O our Sus­tainer! Hasten on to us our share [of punishment even] before the Day of Reckoning!”","3987":"[But] bear thou with patience whatever they may say, and remember Our servant David, him who was endowed with [so much] inner strength! He, verily, would always turn unto Us:","3988":"[and for this,] behold, We caused the mountains to join him in extolling Our limitless glory at eventide and at sun­rise,","3989":"and [likewise] the birds in their assemblies: [together] they all Would turn again and again unto Him [who had created them].","3990":"And We streng­thened his dominion, and bestowed upon him wisdom and sagacity in judgment.","3991":"AND YET, has the story of the litigants come within thy ken - [the story of the two] who surmounted the walls of the sanctuary [in which David prayed]?","3992":"As they came upon David, and he shrank back in fear from them, they said: “Fear not! [We are but] two litigants. One of us has wronged the other: so judge thou between us with justice, and deviate not from what is right, and show [both of] us the way to rectitude.","3993":"“Behold, this is my brother: he has ninety-nine ewes, whereas I have [only] one ewe - and yet he said, ‘Make her over to me,’ and forcibly prevailed against me in this [our] dispute.”","3994":"Said [David]: “He has certainly wronged thee by demanding that thy ewe be added to his ewes! Thus, behold, do many kinsmen wrong one another [all] save those who believe [in God] and do righteous deeds: but how few are they!” And [suddenly] David understood that We had tried him: and so he asked his Sustainer to forgive him his sin, and fell down in prostration, and turned unto Him in repentance.","3995":"And thereupon We forgave him that [sin]: and, verily, nearness to Us awaits him [in the life to come], and the most beauteous of all goals!","3996":"[And We said:] “O David! Behold, We have made thee a [prophet and, thus, Our] vicegerent on earth: judge, then, between men with justice, and do not follow vain desire, lest it lead thee astray from the path of God: verily, for those who go astray from the path of God there is suffering severe in store for having forgotten the Day of Reckoning!”","3997":"AND [thus it is:] We have not created heaven and earth and all that is between them without meaning and purpose, as is the surmise of those who are bent on denying the truth: but then, woe from the fire [of hell] unto all who are bent on denying the truth!","3998":"[For,] would We treat those who have attained to faith and do righteous deeds in the same manner as [We shall treat] those who spread corruption on earth? Would We treat the God-conscious in the same manner as the wicked?","3999":"[All this have We expounded in this] blessed divine writ which We have revealed unto thee, [O Muhammad,] so that men may ponder over its mes­sages, and that those who are endowed with insight may take them to heart.","4000":"AND UNTO DAVID We granted Solomon [as a son - and] how excellent a servant [of Ours he grew up to be]! Behold, he would always turn unto Us -","4001":"[and even] when, towards the close of day, nobly-bred, swift-footed steeds were brought before him,","4002":"he would say, “Verily, I have come to love the love of all that is good because I bear my Sustainer in mind!” [repeating these words as the steeds raced away,] until they were hidden by the veil [of distance - whereupon he would command],","4003":"“Bring them back unto me!”- and would [lovingly] stroke their legs and their necks.","4004":"But [ere this], indeed, We had tried Solomon by placing upon his throne a [lifeless] body; and thereupon he turned [towards Us; and]","4005":"he prayed: “O my Sustainer! Forgive me my sins, and bestow upon me the gift of a kingdom which may not suit anyone after me: verily, Thou alone art a giver of gifts!”","4006":"And so We made subservient to him the wind, so that it gently sped at his behest whithersoever he willed,","4007":"as well as all the rebellious forces [that We made to work for him] - every kind of builder and diver -","4008":"and others linked together in fetters.","4009":"[And We told him:] “This is Our gift, for thee to bestow freely on others, or to withhold, without [having to render] account!”","4010":"And, verily, nearness to Us awaits him [in the life to come], and the most beauteous of all goals!","4011":"AND CALL to mind Our servant Job, [how it was] when he cried out to his Sustainer, “Behold, Satan has afflicted me with [utter] weariness and suffering!”","4012":"[and thereupon was told:] “Strike [the ground] with thy foot: here is cool water to wash with and to drink!”","4013":"And We bestowed upon him new offspring, doubling their number as an act of grace from Us, and as a reminder unto all who are endowed with insight.","4014":"[And finally We told him:] “Now take in thy hand a small bunch of grass, and strike therewith, and thou wilt not break thine oath!” for, verily, We found him full of patience in adversity: how excellent a servant [of Ours], who, behold, would always turn unto Us!","4015":"AND CALL to mind Our servants Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, [all of them] endowed with inner strength and vision:","4016":"for, verily, We purified them by means of a thought most pure: the remembrance of the life to come.","4017":"And, behold, in Our sight they were indeed among the elect, the truly good!","4018":"And call to mind Ishmael and Elisha, and every one who [like them] has pledged himself [unto Us]: for, each of them was of the truly good!","4019":"LET [all] this be a reminder [to those who believe in God] - for, verily, the most beauteous of all goals awaits the God-conscious:","4020":"gardens of perpetual bliss, with gates wide-open to them,","4021":"wherein they will recline, [and] wherein they may [freely] call for many a fruit and drink,","4022":"having beside them well-matched mates of modest gaze.”","4023":"This is what you are promised for the Day of Reckoning:","4024":"this, verily, shall be Our provision [for you], with no end to it!","4025":"All this [for the righteous]: but, verily, the most evil of all goals awaits those who are wont to transgress the bounds of what is right:","4026":"hell will they have to endure - and how vile a resting-place!","4027":"This, [then, for them -] so let them taste it: burning despair and ice-cold darkness","4028":"and, coupled with it, further [suffering] of a similar nature.","4029":"[And they will say to one another: “Do you see] this crowd of people who rushed headlong [into sin] with you?

It is you who have prepared this for us: and how vile a state to abide in!”","4031":"[And] they will pray: “O our Sustainer! Who­ever has prepared this for us, double Thou his suffering in the fire!”","4032":"And they will add: “How is it that we do not see [here any of the] men whom we were wont to count among the wicked,","4033":"[and] whom we made the target of our derision?

And yet, they who take for their protectors aught beside Him [are wont to say], “We worship them for no other reason than that they bring us nearer to God.” Behold, God will judge between them [on Resur­rection Day] with regard to all wherein they differ [from the truth]: for, verily, God does not grace with His guidance anyone who is bent on lying [to himself and is] stubbornly ingrate!","4062":"Had God willed to take Unto Himself a son, He could have chosen anyone that He wanted out of whatever He has created - [but] limitless is He in His glory! He is the One God, the One who holds absolute sway over all that exists!","4063":"He it is who has created the heavens and the earth in accordance with [an inner] truth. He causes the night to flow into the day, and causes the day to flow into the night; and He has made the sun and the moon subservient [to His laws], each running its course for a term set [by Him].

In time, unto your Sustainer you all must return, and then He will make you [truly] understand all that you were doing [in life]: for, verily, He has full knowledge of what is in the hearts [of men].","4066":"NOW [thus it is:] when affliction befalls man, he is likely to cry out to his Sustainer, turning unto Him [for help]; but as soon as He has bestowed upon him a boon by His grace, he forgets Him whom he in­voked before, and claims that there are other powers that could rival God - and thus leads [others] astray from His path.

Such is God’s guidance: He guides therewith him that wills [to be guided] whereas he whom God lets go astray can never find any guide","4082":"Could, then, one who shall have nothing but is [bare] face to protect him from the awful suffering [that will befall him] on Resurrection Day [be likened to the God-conscious]? [On that Day,] the evildoers will be told: “Taste [now] what you have earned [in life]!”","4083":"Those who lived before them did [too] give the lie to the truth - whereupon suffering befell them without their having perceived whence it came:","4084":"and thus God let them taste ignominy [even] in the life of this world.

[Say, therefore:] “Such is God, my Sustainer: in Him have I placed my trust, and unto Him do I always turn!”","4283":"The Originator [is He] of the heavens and the earth. He has given you mates of your own kind just as [He has willed that] among the beasts [there be] mates - to multiply you thereby: [but] there is nothing like unto Him, and He alone is all-hearing, all-seeing.","4284":"His are the keys of the heavens and the earth: He grants abundant sustenance, or gives it in scant measure, unto whomever He wills: for, behold, He has full knowledge of everything.","4285":"In matters of faith, He has ordained for you that which He had enjoined upon Noah - and into which We gave thee [O Muhammad] insight through revelation as well as that which We had enjoined upon Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus: Steadfastly uphold the [true] faith, and do not break up your unity therein. [And even though] that [unity of faith] to which thou callest them appears oppressive to those who are wont to ascribe to other beings or forces a share in His divinity, God draws unto Himself everyone who is willing, and guides unto Himself everyone who turns unto Him.","4286":"And [as for the followers of earlier revelation,] they broke up their unity, out of mutual jealousy, only after they had come to know [the truth]. And had it not been for a decree that had already gone forth from thy Sustainer, [postponing all decision] until a term set [by Him], all would indeed have been decided between them [from the outset]. As it is, behold, they who have inherited their divine writ from those who preceded them are [now] in grave doubt, amounting to suspicion, about what it por­tends.","4287":"Because of this, then, summon [all mankind], and pursue the right course, as thou hast been bidden [by God]; and do not follow their likes and dislikes, but say: “I believe in whatever revelation God has be­stowed from on high; and I am bidden to bring about equity in your mutual views. God is our Sustainer as well as your Sustainer. To us shall be accounted our deeds, and to you, your deeds. Let there be no contention between us and you: God will bring us all together - for with Him is all journeys’ end.”","4288":"And as for those who would [still] argue about God after He has been acknowledged [by them] all their arguments are null and void in their Sustainer’s sight, and upon them will fall [His] condemnation, and for them is suffering severe in store:","4289":"[for] it is God [Himself] who has bestowed revelation from on high, setting forth the truth, and [thus given man] a balance [wherewith to weigh right and wrong]. And for all thou knowest, the Last Hour may well be near!","4290":"Those who do not believe in it [mockingly] ask for its speedy advent whereas those who have attained to faith stand in awe of it, and know it to be the truth. Oh, verily, they who call the Last Hour in question have indeed gone far astray!","4291":"GOD is most kind unto His creatures: He provides sustenance for whomever He wills - for He alone is powerful, almighty!","4292":"To him who desires a harvest in the life to come, We shall grant an increase in his harvest; whereas to him who desires [but] a harvest in this world, We [may] give something thereof - but he will have no share in [the blessings of] the life to come.","4293":"Is it that they [who care for no more than this world] believe in forces supposed to have a share in God’s divinity, which enjoin upon them as a moral law something that God has never allowed? Now were it not for [God’s] decree on the final judgment, all would indeed have been decided be­tween them [in this world]: but, verily, grievous suffering awaits the evildoers [in the life to come].","4294":"[In that life to come,] thou wilt see the evil­doers full of fear at [the thought of] what they have earned: for [now] it is bound to fall back upon them. And in the flowering meadows of the gardens [of paradise thou wilt see] those who have attained to faith and done righteous deeds: all that they might desire shall they have with their Sustainer: [and] this, this is the great bounty –","4295":"that [bounty] whereof God gives the glad tiding to such of His servants as attain to faith and do righteous deeds. Say [O Prophet]: “No reward do I ask of you for this [message] other than [that you should] love your fellow-men.” For, if anyone gains [the merit of] a good deed, We shall grant him through it an increase of good: and, verily, God is much-forgiving, ever responsive to gratitude.","4296":"DO THEY, perchance, say, “[Muhammad] has attri­buted his own lying inventions to God”? But then, had God so willed, He could have sealed thy heart [forever]: for God blots out all falsehood, and by His words proves the truth to be true. Verily, He has full knowledge of what is in the hearts [of men];","4297":"and it is He who accepts repen­tance from His servants, and pardons bad deeds, and knows all that you do,","4298":"and responds unto all who attain to faith and do righteous deeds; and [it is He who, in the life to come,] will give them, out of His bounty, far more [than they will have deserved], whereas for the deniers of the truth there is [but] suffering severe in store.","4299":"For, if God were to grant [in this world] abundant sustenance to [all of] His servants, they would behave on earth with wanton insolence: but as it is, He bestows [His grace] from on high in due measure, as He wills: for, verily, He is fully aware of [the needs of] His creatures, and sees them all.","4300":"And it is He who sends down rain after [men] have lost all hope, and unfolds His grace [thereby]: for He alone is [their] Protector, the One to whom all praise is due.","4301":"And among His signs is the [very] creation of the heavens and the earth, and of all the living creatures which He has caused to multiply throughout them: and [since He has created them,] He has [also] the power to gather them [unto Him­self] whenever He wills.","4302":"Now whatever calamity may befall you [on Judgment Day] will be an outcome of what your own hands have wrought, although He pardons much;","4303":"and you cannot elude Him on earth, and you will have none to protect you from God [in the life to come], and none to bring you succour.","4304":"And among His signs are the ships that sail like [floating] mountains through the seas:","4305":"if He so wills, He stills the wind, and then they lie motion­less on the sea’s surface - [and] herein, behold, there are messages indeed for all who are wholly patient in adversity and deeply grateful [to God];","4306":"or else He may cause them to perish because of what they have wrought; and [withal,] He pardons much.","4307":"And let them know, those who call Our mes­sages in question, that for them there is no escape.","4308":"AND [remember that] whatever you are given [now] is but for the [passing] enjoyment of life in this world - whereas that which is with God is far better and more enduring. [It shall be given] to all who attain to faith and in their Sustainer place their trust;","4309":"and who shun the more heinous sins and abominations; and who, whenever they are moved to anger, readily forgive;","4310":"and who respond to [the call of] their Sustainer and are constant in prayer; and whose rule [in all matters of common concern] is consultation among themselves; and who spend on others out of what We provide for them as sustenance;","4311":"and who, whenever tyranny afflicts them, defend themselves.","4312":"But [remember that an attempt at] requiting evil may, too, become an evil: hence, whoever par­dons [his foe] and makes peace, his reward rests with God - for, verily, He does not love evildoers.","4313":"Yet indeed, as for any who defend themselves after having been wronged - no blame whatever attaches to them:","4314":"blame attaches but to those who oppress [other] people and behave outrageously on earth, offending against all right: for them there is grievous suffering in store!","4315":"But withal, if one is patient in adversity and forgives - this, behold, is indeed something to set one’s heart upon!","4316":"AND [thus it is:] he whom God lets go astray has henceforth no protector whatever: and so thou wilt see such evildoers [on Judgment Day, and wilt hear how] they exclaim as soon as they behold the suffering [that awaits them], “Is there any way of return?”","4317":"And thou wilt see them exposed to that [doom], humbling themselves in abasement, looking [around] with a furtive glance - the while those who had attained to faith will say, “Verily, lost on [this] Day of Resurrection are they who have squandered their own and their followers’ selves!” Oh, verily, the evildoers will fall into long-lasting suffering,","4318":"and will have no protector whatever to succour them against God: for he whom God lets go astray shall find no way [of escape].","4319":"[Hence, O men,] respond to your Sustainer before there comes, at God’s behest, a Day on which there will be no turning back: [for] on that Day you will have no place of refuge, and neither will you be able to deny aught [of the wrong that you have done].","4320":"BUT IF they turn away [from thee, O Prophet, know that] We have not sent thee to be their keeper: thou art not bound to do more than deliver the message [entrusted to thee]. And, behold, [such as turn away from Our mes­sages are but impelled by the weakness and incon­stancy of human nature: thus,] when We give man a taste of Our grace, he is prone to exult in it; but if misfortune befalls [any of] them in result of what their own hands have sent forth, then, behold, man shows how bereft he is of all gratitude!","4321":"God’s alone is the dominion over the heavens and the earth. He creates whatever He wills: He bestows the gift of female offspring on whomever He wills, and the gift of male offspring on whomever He wills;","4322":"or He gives both male and female [to whomever He wills], and causes to be barren whomever He wills: for, verily, He is all-knowing, infinite in His power.","4323":"And it is not given to mortal man that God should speak unto him otherwise than through sudden inspiration, or [by a voice, as it were,] from behind a veil, or by sending an apostle to reveal, by His leave, whatever He wills [to reveal]: for, verily, He is exalted, wise.","4324":"And thus, too, [O Muhammad,] have We revealed unto thee a life-giving message, [coming] at Our behest. [Ere this message came unto thee,] thou didst not know what revelation is, nor what faith [implies]: but [now] We have caused this [message] to be a light, whereby We guide whom We will of Our ser­vants: and, verily, [on the strength thereof] thou, too, shalt guide [men] onto the straight way –","4325":"the way that leads to God, to whom all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth belongs. Oh, verily, with God is the beginning and the end of all things!","4326":"Ha. Mim.","4327":"CONSIDER this divine writ, clear in itself and clearly showing the truth:","4328":"behold, We have caused it to be a discourse in the Arabic tongue, so that you might encompass it with your reason.","4329":"And, verily, [originating as it does] in the source, with Us, of all revelation, it is indeed sublime, full of wisdom.","4330":"[O YOU who deny the truth!] Should We, perchance, withdraw this reminder from you altogether, seeing that you are people bent on wasting your own selves?","4331":"And how many a prophet did We send to people of olden times!","4332":"But never yet came a prophet to them without their deriding him –","4333":"and so, [in the end,] We destroyed them [even though they were] of greater might than these: and the [very] image of those people of old became a thing of the past.","4334":"Yet thus it is [with most people]: if thou ask them, “Who is it that has created the heavens and the earth?” - they will surely answer, “The Almighty, the All-Knowing has created them.”","4335":"He it is who has made the earth a cradle for you, and has provided for you ways [of livelihood] thereon, so that you might follow the right path.","4336":"And He it is who sends down, again and again, waters from the sky in due measure: and [as] We raise therewith dead land to life, even thus will you be brought forth [from the dead].","4337":"And He it is who has created all opposites. And He [it is who] has provided for you all those ships and animals whereon you ride,","4338":"in order that you might gain mastery over them, and that, whenever you have mastered them, you might remember your Sustainer’s blessings and say: “Limitless in His glory is He who has made [all] this subservient to our use - since [but for Him,] we would not have been able to attain to it.","4339":"Hence, verily, it is unto Him that we must always turn.”","4340":"AND YET, they attribute to Him offspring from among some of the beings created by Him! Verily, most obviously bereft of all gratitude is man!","4341":"Or [do you think], perchance, that out of all His creation He has chosen for Himself daughters, and favoured you with sons?","4342":"For [thus it is:] if any of them is given the glad tiding of [the birth of] what he so readily attributes to the Most Gracious, his face darkens, and he is filled with suppressed anger:","4343":"“What! [Am I to have a daughter -] one who is to be reared [only] for the sake of ornament?” and thereupon he finds himself torn by a vague inner conflict.","4344":"And [yet] they claim that the angels - who in themselves are but beings created by the Most Gracious - are females: [but] did they witness their creation? This false claim of theirs will be recorded, and they will be called to account [for it on Judgment Day]!","4345":"Yet they say, “Had [not] the Most Gracious so willed, we would never have worshipped them!” [But] they cannot have any knowledge of [His having willed] such a thing: they do nothing but guess.","4346":"Or have We, perchance, vouchsafed them, before this one, a revelation [to the contrary,] to which they are still holding fast?","4347":"Nay, but they say, “Behold, We found our forefathers agreed on what to believe - and, verily, it is in their footsteps that we find our guidance!”","4348":"And thus it is: whenever We sent, before thy time, a warner to any community, those of its people who had lost themselves entirely in the pursuit of pleasures would always say, “Behold, we found our forefathers agreed on what to believe - and, verily, it is but in their footsteps that we follow!”","4349":"[Whereupon each prophet] would say, “Why, even though I bring you guidance better than that which you found your forefathers believing in?” - [to which] the others would reply, “Behold, we deny that there is any truth in [what you claim to be] your messages!”","4350":"And so We inflicted Our retribution on them: and behold what happened in the end to those who gave the lie to the truth!","4351":"AND WHEN Abraham spoke to his father and his people, [he had this very truth in mind:] “Verily, far be it from me to worship what you worship!","4352":"None [do I worship] but Him who has brought me into being: and, behold, it is He who will guide me!”","4353":"And he uttered this as a word destined to endure among those who would come after him, so that they might [always] return [to it].","4354":"Now [as for those who did come after him,] I allowed them - as [I had allowed] their forebears - to enjoy their lives freely until the truth should come unto them through an apostle who would make all things clear:","4355":"but now that the truth has come to them, they say, “All this is mere spellbinding eloquence” - and, behold, we deny that there is any truth in it!”","4356":"And they say, too, “Why was not this Qur’an bestowed from on high on some great man of the two cities?”","4357":"But is it they who distribute thy Sustainer’s grace? [Nay, as] it is We who distribute their means of livelihood among them in the life of this world, and raise some of them by degrees above others, to the end that they might avail themselves of one another’s help - [so, too, it is We who bestow gifts of the spirit upon whomever We will]: and this thy Sustainer’s grace is better than all [the worldly wealth] that they may amass.","4358":"And were it not that [with the prospect of boundless riches before them] all people would become one [evil] community, We might indeed have provided for those who [now] deny the Most Gracious roofs of silver for their houses, and [silver] stairways whereon to ascend,","4359":"and [silver] doors for their houses, and [silver] couches whereon to recline,","4360":"and gold [beyond count]. Yet all this would have been nothing but a [brief] enjoyment of life in this world - whereas [happiness in] the life to come awaits the God-conscious with thy Sustainer.","4361":"But as for anyone who chooses to remain blind to the remembrance of the Most Gracious, to him We assign an [enduring] evil impulse, to become his other self:","4362":"whereupon, behold, these [evil impulses] bar all such from the path [of truth], making them think that they are guided aright!","4363":"But in the end, when he [who has thus sinned] appears before us [on Judgment Day], he will say [to his other self], “Would that between me and thee there had been the distance of east and west!” for, evil indeed [has proved] that other self!","4364":"On that Day it will not profit you in the least [to know] that, since you have sinned [together], you are now to share your suffering [as well].","4365":"CANST THOU, perchance, [O Muhammad,] make the deaf hear, or show the right way to the blind or to such as are obviously lost in error?","4366":"But whether We do [or do not] take thee away [ere thy message prevails] - verily, We shall inflict Our retribution on them;","4367":"and whether We show thee [or do not show thee in this world] the fulfillment of what We have promised them - verily, We have full power over them!","4368":"So hold fast to all that has been revealed to thee: for, behold, thou art on a straight way;","4369":"and, verily, this [revelation] shall indeed become [a source of] eminence for thee and thy people: but in time you all will be called to account [for what you have done with it].","4370":"Yet [above all else,] ask any of Our apostles whom We sent forth before thy time whether We have ever allowed that deities other than the Most Gracious be worshipped!","4371":"THUS, INDEED, have We sent Moses with Our messages unto Pharaoh and his great ones; and he said: “Behold, I am an apostle of the Sustainer of all the worlds!”","4372":"But as soon as he came before them with Our [miraculous] signs, lo! they derided them,","4373":"although each sign that We showed them was weigh­tier than the preceding one: and [each time] We took them to task through suffering, so that they might return [to Us].","4374":"And [every time] they exclaimed: “O thou sorcerer!

And [then] We made another people heirs [to what they had left],","4443":"and neither sky nor earth shed tears over them, nor were they allowed a respite.","4444":"And, indeed, We delivered the children of Israel from the shameful suffering","4445":"[inflicted on them] by Pharaoh, seeing that he was truly outstand­ing among those who waste their own selves;","4446":"and indeed, We chose them knowingly above all other people,","4447":"and gave them such signs [of Our grace] as would clearly presage a test.","4448":"[Now,] behold, these [people] say indeed:","4449":"“That [which is ahead of us] is but our first [and only] death, and we shall not be raised to life again.","4450":"So then, bring forth our forefathers [as witnesses], if what you claim is true!”","4451":"Are they, then, better than the people of Tubba and those before them, whom We destroyed because they were truly lost in [the same] sin?","4452":"For [thus it is:] We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in mere idle play:","4453":"none of this have We created without [an inner] truth: but most of them under­stand it not.","4454":"VERILY, the Day of Distinction [between the true and the false] is the term appointed for all of them:","4455":"the Day when no friend shall be of the least avail to his friend, and when none shall be succoured","4456":"save those upon whom God will have bestowed His grace and mercy: for, verily, He alone is almighty, a dispenser of grace.","4457":"Verily, [in the life to come] the tree of deadly fruit","4458":"will be the food of the sinful:","4459":"like molten lead will it boil in the belly,","4460":"like the boiling of burning despair.","4461":"[And the word will be spoken:] “Seize him, [O you forces of hell,] and drag him into the midst of the blazing fire:","4462":"then pour over his head the anguish of burning despair!","4463":"Taste it - thou who [on earth] hast considered thyself so mighty, so noble!","4464":"This is the very thing which you [deniers of the truth] were wont to call in question!”","4465":"[As against this -] verily, the God-conscious will find themselves in a state secure,","4466":"amid gardens and springs,","4467":"wearing [garments] of silk and brocade, facing one another [in love].","4468":"Thus shall it be.

For all such there is shameful suffering in store.","4483":"Hell is ahead of them; and all that they may have gained [in this world] shall be of no avail whatever to them, and neither shall any of those things which, instead of God, they have come to regard as their protectors: for, awesome suffering awaits them.","4484":"[To pay heed to God’s signs and messages:] this is [the meaning of] guidance; on the other hand, for those who are bent on denying the truth of their Sustainer’s messages there is grievous suffering in store as an outcome of [their] vileness.","4485":"IT IS GOD who has made the sea subservient [to His laws, so that it be of use] to you so that ships might sail through it at His behest, and that you might seek to obtain [what you need] of His bounty, and that you might have cause to be grateful.","4486":"And He has made subservient to you, [as a gift] from Himself, all that is in the heavens and on earth: in this, behold, there are messages indeed for people who think!","4487":"Tell all who have attained to faith that they should forgive those who do not believe in the com­ing of the Days of God, [since it is] for Him [alone] to requite people for whatever they may have earned.","4488":"Whoever does what is just and right, does so for his own good; and whoever does evil, does so to his own hurt; and in the end unto your Sustainer you all will be brought back.","4489":"AND, INDEED, [already] unto the children of Israel did We vouchsafe revelation, and wisdom, and prophethood; and We provided for them sustenance out of the good things of life, and favoured them above all other people [of their time].","4490":"And We gave them clear indications of the purpose [of faith]; and it was only after all this knowledge had been vouchsafed to them that they began, out of mutual jealousy, to hold divergent views: [but,] verily, thy Sustainer will judge be­tween them on Resurrection Day regarding all whereon they were wont to differ.","4491":"And, finally, [O Muhammad,] We have set thee on a way by which the purpose [of faith] may be fulfilled: so follow thou this [way], and follow not the likes and dislikes of those who do not know [the truth].","4492":"Behold, they could never be of any avail to thee if thou wert to defy the will of God for, verily, such evildoers are but friends and protectors of one another, whereas God is the Protector of all who are conscious of Him.","4493":"This [revelation, then,] is a means of insight for mankind, and a guidance and grace unto people who are endowed with inner certainty.","4494":"Now as for those who indulge in sinful doings - do they think that We place them, both in their life and their death, on an equal footing with those who have attained to faith and do righteous deeds? Bad, indeed, is their judgment:","4495":"for, God has created the heavens and the earth in accordance with [an inner] truth, and [has therefore willed] that every human being shall be recompensed for what he has earned and none shall be wronged.","4496":"HAST THOU ever considered [the kind of man] who makes his own desires his deity, and whom God has [thereupon] let go astray, knowing [that his mind is closed to all guidance], and whose hearing and heart He has sealed, and upon whose sight He has placed a veil?

[If so,] bring me any divine writ pre­ceding this one, or any [other] vestige of knowledge - if what you claim is true!”","4515":"And who could be more astray than one who invokes, instead of God, such as will not respond to him either now or on the Day of Resurrection, and are not even conscious of being invoked?","4516":"such as, when all mankind is gathered [for judgment], will be enemies unto those [who worshipped them], and will utterly reject their worship?","4517":"But whenever Our messages are conveyed to them in all their clarity, they who are bent on denying the truth speak thus of the truth as soon as it is brought to them: “This is clearly nothing but spell­binding eloquence!”","4518":"Or do they say, “He has invented all this”? Say [O Muhammad]: “Had I invented it, you would not be of the least help to me against God. He is fully aware of that [slander] into which you so reck­lessly plunge: enough is He as a witness between me and you! And [withal,] He alone is truly-forgiving, a true dispenser of grace.”","4519":"Say: “I am not the first of [God’s] apostles; and [like all of them,] I do not know what will be done with me or with you: for I am nothing but a plain warner.”","4520":"Say: “Have you given thought [to how you will fare] if this be truly [a revelation] from God and yet you deny its truth? - even though a witness from among the children of Israel has already borne wit­ness to [the advent of] one like himself, and has believed [in him], the while you glory in your arro­gance [and reject his message]? Verily, God does not grace [such] evildoing folk with His guidance!”","4521":"But they who are bent on denying the truth speak thus of those who have attained to faith: “If this [message] were any good, these [people] would not have preceded us in accepting it!” And since they refuse to be guided by it, they will always say, “This is [but] an ancient falsehood!”","4522":"And yet, before this there was the revelation of Moses, a guide and a [sign of God’s] grace; and this [Qur’an] is a divine writ confirming the truth [of the Torah] in the Arabic tongue, to warn those who are bent on evildoing, and [to bring] a glad tiding to the doers of good:","4523":"for, behold, all who say, “Our Sustainer is God”, and thereafter stand firm [in their faith] - no fear need they have, and neither shall they grieve:","4524":"it is they who are destined for paradise, therein to abide as a reward for all that they have done.","4525":"NOW [among the best of the deeds which] We have enjoined upon man is goodness towards his parents. In pain did his mother bear him, and in pain did she give him birth; and her bearing him and his utter dependence on her took thirty months. and so, when he attains to full maturity and reaches forty years, he [that is righteous] prays: “O my Sustainer! Inspire me so that I may forever be grateful for those blessings of Thine with which Thou hast graced me and my parents, and that I may do what is right [in a manner] that will meet with Thy goodly acceptance; and grant me righteousness in my offspring [as well]. Verily, unto Thee have I turned in repentance: for, verily, I am of those who have surrendered themselves unto Thee!”","4526":"It is [such as] these from whom We shall accept the best that they ever did, and whose bad deeds We shall overlook: [they will find themselves] among those who are destined for paradise, in fulfillment of the true promise which they were given [in this world].","4527":"But [there is many a one] who says to his parents [whenever they try to imbue him with faith in God]: “Fie upon both of you! Do you promise me that I shall be brought forth [from the dead], although [so many] generations have passed away before me?” And [while] they both pray for God’s help [and say], “Alas for thee! For, behold, God’s promise always comes true!” - he but answers, “All this is nothing but fables of ancient times!”","4528":"It is [such as] these upon whom the sentence [of doom] will fall due, together with the [other sinful] communities of invisible beings and humans that have passed away before their time. Verily, they will be lost:","4529":"for, [in the life to come,] all shall have their degrees in accordance with whatever [good or evil] they did: and so, He will repay them in full for their doings, and none shall be wronged.","4530":"And on the Day when those who were bent on denying the truth will be brought within sight of the fire, [they will be told:] “You have exhausted your [share of] good things in your worldly life, having enjoyed them [without any thought of the hereafter]: and so today you shall be requited with the suffering of humiliation for having gloried on earth in your arrogance, offending against all that is right, and for all your iniquitous doings!”","4531":"AND REMEMBER that brother of [the tribe of] Ad, how - seeing that [other] warnings had already come and gone within his own knowledge as well as in times beyond his ken - he warned his people [who lived] among those sand-dunes: “Worship none but God! Verily, I fear lest suffering befall you on an awesome day!”","4532":"They answered: “Hast thou come to seduce us away from our gods? Bring, then, upon us that [doom] with which thou threaten us, if thou art a man of truth!”","4533":"Said he: “Knowledge [of when it is to befall you] rests with God alone: I but convey unto you the message with which I have been entrusted; but I see that you are people ignorant [of right and wrong]!”","4534":"And so, when they beheld it in the shape of a dense cloud approaching their valleys, they exclaimed, “This is but a heavy cloud which will bring us [wel­come] rain!” [But Hud said:] “Nay, but it is the very thing which you [so contemptuously] sought to hasten - a wind bearing grievous suffering,","4535":"bound to destroy everything at its Sustainer’s behest!” And then they were so utterly wiped out that nothing could be seen save their [empty] dwellings: thus do We requite people lost in sin.","4536":"And yet, We had established them securely in a manner in which We have never established you, [O people of later times;] and We had endowed them with hearing, and sight, and [knowledgeable] hearts: but neither their hearing, nor their sight, nor their hearts were of the least avail to them, seeing that they went on rejecting God’s messages; and [in the end] they were overwhelmed by the very thing which they had been wont to deride.","4537":"Thus have We destroyed many a [sinful] community living round about you; and yet, [before destroying them,] We had given many facets to [Our warning] messages, so that they might turn back [from their evil ways].","4538":"But, then, did those [beings] whom they had chosen to worship as deities beside God, hoping that they would bring them nearer [to Him], help them [in the end]? Nay, they forsook them: for that [alleged divinity] was but an outcome of their self-delusion and all their false imagery.","4539":"AND LO! We caused a group of unseen beings to incline towards thee, [O Muhammad,] so that they might give ear to the Qur’an; and so, as soon as they became aware of it, they said [unto one another], “Listen in silence!” And when [the recitation] was ended, they returned to their people as warners.","4540":"They said: “O our people! Behold, we have been listening to a revelation bestowed from on high after [that of] Moses, confirming the truth of what­ever there still remains [of the Torah]: it guides towards the truth, and onto a straight way.","4541":"“O our people! Respond to God’s call, and have faith in Him: He will forgive you [whatever is past] of your sins, and deliver you from grievous suffering [in the life to come].","4542":"But he who does not respond to God’s call can never elude [Him] on earth, nor can he has any protector against Him [in the life to come]: all such are most obviously lost in error.”","4543":"ARE, THEN, they [who deny the life to come] not aware that God, who has created the heavens and the earth and never been wearied by their creation, has [also] the power to bring the dead back to life? Yea, verily, He has the power to will anything!","4544":"And so, on the Day when those who were bent on denying the truth will be brought within sight of the fire [and will be asked], “Is not this the truth?” - they will answer, “Yea, by Our Sustainer!” [And] He will say: “Taste, then, this suffering as an outcome of your denial of the truth!”","4545":"REMAIN, then, [O believer,] patient in adversity, just as all of the apostles, endowed with firmness of heart, bore themselves with patience. And do not ask for a speedy doom of those [who still deny the truth]: on the Day when they see [the fulfillment of] what they were promised, [it will seem to them] as though they had dwelt [on earth] no longer than one hour of [an earthly] day! [This is Our] message. Will, then, any be [really] destroyed save iniquitous folk?”","4546":"AS FOR THOSE who are bent on denying the truth and on barring [others] from the path of God - all their [good] deeds will He let go to waste;","4547":"whereas those who have attained to faith and do righteous deeds, and have come to believe in what has been bestowed from on high on Muhammad - for it is the truth from their Sustainer - [shall attain to God’s grace:] He will efface their [past] bad deeds, and will set their hearts at rest.","4548":"This, because they who are bent on denying the truth pursue falsehood, whereas they who have attained to faith pursue [but] the truth [that flows] from their Sustainer. In this way does God set forth unto man the parables of their true state.","4549":"NOW WHEN you meet [in war] those who are bent on denying the truth, smite their necks until you overcome them fully, and then tighten their bonds; but thereafter [set them free,] either by an act of grace or against ransom, so that the burden of war may be lifted: thus [shall it be]. And [know that] had God so willed, He could indeed punish them [Himself]; but [He wills you to struggle] so as to test you [all] by means of one another. And as for those who are slain in God’s cause, never will He let their deeds go to waste:","4550":"He will guide them [in the hereafter as well], and will set their hearts at rest,","4551":"and will admit them to the paradise which He has promised them.","4552":"O you who have attained to faith! If you help [the cause of] God, He will help you, and will make firm your steps;","4553":"but as for those who are bent on denying the truth, ill fortune awaits them, since He will let all their [good] deeds go to waste:","4554":"this, because they hate [the very thought of] what God has bestowed from on high and thus He causes all their deeds to come to nought!","4555":"Have they, then, never journeyed about the earth and beheld what happened in the end to those [willful sinners] who lived before their time? God destroyed them utterly: and the like thereof awaits all who deny the truth.","4556":"This, because God is the Protector of all who have attained to faith, whereas they who deny the truth have no protector.","4557":"Verily, God will admit all who attain to faith and do righteous deeds into gardens through which running waters flow, whereas they who are bent on denying the truth shall have - even though they may enjoy their life [in this world] and eat as cattle eat - the fire [of the hereafter] for their abode.","4558":"And how many a community of greater power than this thy community which has driven thee out, [O Muhammad,] have We destroyed, with none to succour them!","4559":"CAN, THEN, he who takes his stand on a clear evidence from his Sustainer be likened Unto one to whom the evil of his own doings [always] seems goodly, and unto such as would follow but their own lusts?","4560":"[And can] the parable of the paradise which the God-conscious are promised [a paradise] wherein there are rivers of water which time does not corrupt, and rivers of milk the taste whereof never alters, and rivers of wine delightful to those who drink it, and rivers of honey of all impurity cleansed, and the enjoyment of all the fruits [of their good deeds] and of forgiveness from their Sustainer -: can this [parable of paradise] be likened unto [the parable of the recompense of] such as are to abide in the fire and be given waters of burning despair to drink, so that it will tear their bowels asunder?","4561":"Now among those [hapless sinners] are such as [pretend to] listen to thee, [O Muhammad,] and then, as soon as they leave thy presence, speak [with scorn] unto those who have understood [thy mes­sage]: “What is it that he has said just now?” It is such as these whose hearts God has sealed because they [always] followed but their own lusts","4562":"just as for those who are [willing to be] guided, He increases their [ability to follow His] guidance and causes them to grow in God-consciousness.","4563":"Are, then, they [whose hearts are sealed] wait­ing for the Last Hour - [waiting] that it come upon them of a sudden? But it has already been foretold! And what will their remembrance [of their past sins] avail them, once it has come upon them?","4564":"Know, then, [O man,] that there is no deity save God, and [while there is yet time,] ask forgive­ness for thy sins and for [the sins of] all other believing men and women: for God knows all your comings and goings as well as your abiding [at rest].","4565":"NOW THOSE who have attained to faith say, “Would that a revelation [allowing us to fight] was bestowed from on high!” But now that a revelation clear in and by itself, mentioning war, has been bestowed from on high, thou canst see those in whose hearts is disease look­ing at thee, [O Muhammad,] with the look of one who is about to faint for fear of death! And yet, far better for them would be","4566":"obedience [to God’s call] and a word that could win [His] approval: for, since the matter has been resolved [by His revelation], it would be but for their own good to remain true to God.","4567":"[Ask them:] “Would you, perchance, after having turned away [from God’s commandment, pre­fer to revert to your old ways, and] spread corruption on earth, and [once again] cut asunder your ties of kinship?”","4568":"It is such as these whom God rejects, and whom He makes deaf [to the voice of truth], and whose eyes He blinds [to its sight]!","4569":"Will they not, then, ponder over this Qur’an? - or are there locks upon their hearts?","4570":"VERILY, those who turn their backs [on this mes­sage] after guidance has been vouchsafed to them, [do it because] Satan has embellished their fancies and filled them with false hopes:","4571":"[they do turn their backs on it] inasmuch as they are wont to say unto those who abhor all that God has revealed, “We will comply with your views on some points.” But God knows their secret thoughts:","4572":"hence, how [will they fare] when the angels gather them in death, striking their faces and their backs?","4573":"This, because they were wont to pursue what God con­demns and to hate [whatever would meet with] His goodly acceptance: and so He has caused all their [good] deeds to come to nought.","4574":"Or do they in whose hearts is disease think, perchance, that God would never bring their moral failings to light?","4575":"Now had We so willed, We could have shown them clearly to thee, so that thou wouldst know them for sure as by a visible mark: but [even so,] thou wilt most certainly recognize them by the tone of their voice.

And withal, He does not demand of you [to sacrifice in His cause all of] your possessions:","4582":"[for,] if He were to demand of you all of them, and urge you, you would niggardly cling [to them], and so He would [but] bring out your moral failings.","4583":"Behold, [O believers,] it is you who are called upon to spend freely in God’s cause: but [even] among you are such as turn out to be niggardly! And yet, he who acts niggardly [in God’s cause] is but niggardly towards his own self: for God is indeed self-sufficient, whereas you stand in need [of Him]; and if you turn away [from Him], He will cause other people to take your place, and they will not be the likes of you!","4584":"VERILY, [O Muhammad,] We have laid open before thee a manifest victory,","4585":"so that God might show His forgiveness of all thy faults, past as well as future, and [thus] bestow upon thee the full measure of His blessings, and guide thee on a straight way,","4586":"and [show] that God will succour thee with [His] mighty succour.","4587":"It is He who from on high has bestowed inner peace upon the hearts of the believers, so that - seeing that God’s are all the forces of the heavens and the earth, and that God is all-knowing, truly wise - they might grow yet more firm in their faith;","4588":"[and] that He might admit the believers, both men and women, into gardens through which running waters flow, therein to abide, and that He might efface their [past bad] deeds: and that is, in the sight of God, indeed a triumph supreme!","4589":"And [God has willed] to impose suffering [in the life to come] on the hypocrites, both men and women, and on those who ascribe divinity to aught beside Him, both men and women: all who entertain evil thoughts about God. Evil encompasses them from all sides, and God’s condemnation rests upon them; and He has rejected them [from His grace], and has readied hell for them: and how evil a journey’s end!","4590":"For, God’s are all the forces of the heavens and the earth; and God is indeed almighty, truly wise!","4591":"VERILY, [O Muhammad,] We have sent thee as a witness [to the truth], and as a herald of glad tidings and a warner –","4592":"so that you [O men] might believe in God and His Apostle, and might honour Him, and revere Him, and extol His limitless glory from morn to evening.","4593":"Behold, all who pledge their allegiance to thee pledge their allegiance to God: the hand of God is over their hands. Hence, he who breaks his oath, breaks it only to his own hurt; whereas he who remains true to what he has pledged unto God, on him will He bestow a reward supreme.","4594":"Those of the bedouin who stayed behind will say unto thee: “[The need to take care of] our chat­tels and our families kept us busy: do then, [O Prophet,] ask God to forgive us!” [Thus,] they will utter with their tongues something that is not in their hearts. Say: “Who, then, has it in his power to avert from you aught that God may have willed, whether it be His will to harm you or to confer a benefit on you? Nay, but God is fully aware of what you do!","4595":"Nay, you thought that the Apostle and the believers would never return to their kith and kin: and this seemed goodly to your hearts. And you entertained [such] evil thoughts because you have always been people devoid of all good!”","4596":"Now as for those who will not believe in God and His Apostle - verily, We have readied a blazing flame for all [such] deniers of the truth!","4597":"But God’s is the dominion over the heavens and the earth: He forgives whomever He wills, and imposes suffering on whomever He wills - and [withal,] He is indeed much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace.","4598":"As soon as you [O believers] are about to set forth on a war that promises booty, those who stayed behind [aforetime] will surely say, “Allow us to go with you” - [thus showing that] they would like to alter the Word of God. Say: “By no means shall you go with us: God has declared aforetime [to whom all spoils shall belong].” Thereupon they will [surely] answer, “Nay, but you begrudge us [our share of booty]!” Nay, they can grasp but so little of the truth!","4599":"Say unto those bedouin who stayed behind: “In time you will be called upon [to fight] against people of great prowess in war: you will have to fight against them [until you die] or they surrender. And then, if you heed [that call], God will bestow on you a goodly reward; but if you turn away as you turned away this time, He will chastise you with grievous chastisement.”","4600":"No blame attaches to the blind, nor does blame attach to the lame, nor does blame attach to the sick [for staying away from a war in God’s cause]; but whoever heeds [the call of] God and His Apostle [in deed or in heart], him will He admit into gardens through which running waters flow; whereas him who turns away will He chastise with grievous chastise­ment.","4601":"INDEED, well-pleased was God with the believers when they pledged their allegiance unto thee [O Muhammad] under that tree, for He knew what was in their hearts; and so He bestowed inner peace upon them from on high, and rewarded them with [the glad tiding of] a victory soon to come","4602":"and [of] many war-gains which they would achieve: for God is indeed almighty, wise.","4603":"[O you who believe!] God has promised you many war-gains which you shall yet achieve; and He has vouchsafed you these [worldly gains] well in advance, and has stayed from you the hands of [hostile] people, so that this [your inner strength] may become a symbol to the believers [who will come after you], and that He may guide you all on a straight way.","4604":"And there are yet other [gains] which are still beyond your grasp, [but] which God has already encompassed [for you]: for God has the power to will anything.","4605":"And [now,] if they who are bent on denying the truth should fight against you, they will indeed turn their backs [in flight], and will find none to protect them and none to bring them succour:","4606":"such being God’s way which has ever obtained in the past - and never wilt thou find any change in God’s way!","4607":"And He it is who, in the valley of Mecca, stayed their hands from you, and your hands from them, after He had enabled you to vanquish them; and God saw indeed what you were doing.","4608":"[It was not for your enemies sake that He stayed your hands from them: for] it was they who were bent on denying the truth, and who debarred you from the Inviolable House of Worship and prevented your offering from reaching its destina­tion. And had it not been for the believing men and believing women [in Mecca], whom you might have unwittingly trampled underfoot, and on whose account you might have become guilty, without knowing it, of a grievous wrong-: [had it not been for this, you would have been allowed to fight your way into the city: but you were forbidden to fight] so that [in time] God might admit to His grace whomever He wills. Had they [who deserve Our mercy and they whom We have condemned] been clearly discernible [to you], We would indeed have imposed grievous suffering [at your hands] on such of them as were bent on denying the truth.","4609":"Whereas they who are bent on denying the truth harboured a stubborn disdain in their hearts - the stubborn disdain [born] of ignorance God bestowed from on high His [gift of] inner peace upon His Apostle and the believers, and bound them to the spirit of God-consciousness: for they were most worthy of this [divine gift], and deserved it well. And God has full knowledge of all things.","4610":"Indeed, God has shown the truth in His Apostle’s true vision: most certainly shall you enter the Inviolable House of Worship, if God so wills, in full security, with your heads shaved or your hair cut short, without any fear: for He has [always] known that which you yourselves could not know. And He has ordained [for you], besides this, a victory soon to come.","4611":"He it is who has sent forth His Apostle with the [task of spreading] guidance and the religion of truth, to the end that He make it prevail over every [false] religion; and none can bear witness [to the truth] as God does.","4612":"MUHAMMAD is God’s Apostle; and those who are [truly] with him are firm and unyielding towards all deniers of the truth, [yet] full of mercy towards one another. Thou canst see them bowing down, pros­trating themselves [in prayer], seeking favour with God and [His] goodly acceptance: their marks are on their faces, traced by prostration. This is their parable in the Torah as well as their parable in the Gospel: [they are] like a seed that brings forth its shoot, and then He strengthens it, so that it grows stout, and [in the end] stands firm upon its stem, delighting the sowers. [Thus will God cause the believers to grow in strength,] so that through them He might confound the deniers of the truth. [But] unto such of them as may [yet] attain to faith and do righteous deeds, God has promised forgiveness and a reward supreme.","4613":"O YOU who have attained to faith! Do not put yourselves forward in the presence of [what] God and His Apostle [may have ordained], but remain conscious of God: for, verily, God is all-hearing, all-knowing!","4614":"O you who have attained to faith! Do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet, and neither speak loudly to him, as you would speak loudly to one another, lest all your [good] deeds come to nought without your perceiving it.","4615":"Behold, they who lower their voices in the presence of God’s Apostle - it is they whose hearts God has tested [and opened] to consciousness of Himself; [and] theirs shall be forgiveness and a reward supreme.","4616":"Verily, [O Prophet,] as for those who call thee from without thy private apartments - most of them do not use their reason:","4617":"for, if they had the patience [to wait] until thou come forth to them [of thine own accord], it would be for their own good. Still, God is much forgiving, a dispenser of grace.","4618":"O YOU who have attained to faith! If any iniquitous person comes to you with a [slanderous] tale, use your discernment, lest you hurt people unwittingly and afterwards be filled with remorse for what you have done.","4619":"And know that God’s Apostle is among you: were he to comply with your inclinations in each and every case, you would be bound to come to harm [as a community]. But as it is, God has caused [your] faith to be dear to you, and has given it beauty in your hearts, and has made hateful to you all denial of the truth, and all iniquity, and all rebellion [against what is good]. Such indeed are they who follow the right course","4620":"through God’s bounty and favour; and God is all-knowing, truly wise.","4621":"Hence, if two groups of believers fall to fighting, make peace between them; but then, if one of the two [groups] goes on acting wrongfully towards the other, fight against the one that acts wrongfully until it reverts to God’s commandment; and if they revert, make peace between them with justice, and deal equitably [with them]: for verily, God loves those who act equitably!","4622":"All believers are but brethren. Hence, [when­ever they are at odds,] make peace between your two brethren, and remain conscious of God, so that you might be graced with His mercy.","4623":"O YOU who have attained to faith! No men shall deride [other] men: it may well be that those [whom they deride] are better than themselves; and no women [shall deride other] women: it may well be that those [whom they deride] are better than them­selves. And neither shall you defame one another, nor insult one another by [opprobrious] epithets: evil is all imputation of iniquity after [one has attained to] faith; and they who [become guilty thereof and] do not repent - it is they, they who are evildoers!","4624":"O you who have attained to faith! Avoid most guesswork [about one another] for, behold, some of [such] guesswork is [in itself] a sin; and do not spy upon one another, and neither allow your­selves to speak ill of one another behind your backs. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? Nay, you would loathe it! And be conscious of God. Verily, God is an accep­tor of repentance, a dispenser of grace!","4625":"O men! Behold, We have created you all out of a male and a female, and have made you into nations and tribes, so that you might come to know one another. Verily, the noblest of you in the sight of God is the one who is most deeply conscious of Him. Behold, God is all-knowing, all-aware.","4626":"THE BEDOUIN say, “We have attained to faith.” Say [unto them, O Muhammad]: “You have not [yet] attained to faith; you should [rather] say, ‘We have [outwardly] surrendered’ - for [true] faith has not yet entered your hearts.

Such a return seems far-fetched indeed!”","4634":"Well do We know how the earth consumes their bodies, for with Us is a record unfailing.","4635":"Nay, but they [who refuse to believe in resurrection] have been wont to give the lie to this truth whenever it was proffered to them; and so they are in a state of confusion.","4636":"Do they not look at the sky above them - how We have built it and made it beautiful and free of all faults?","4637":"And the earth - We have spread it wide, and set upon it mountains firm, and caused it to bring forth plants of all beauteous kinds,","4638":"thus offering an insight and a reminder unto every human being who willingly turns unto God.","4639":"And We send down from the skies water rich in blessings, and cause thereby gardens to grow, and fields of grain,","4640":"and tall palm-trees with their thickly-clustered dates,","4641":"as sustenance appor­tioned to men; and by [all] this We bring dead land to life: [and] even so will be [man’s] coming-forth from death.","4642":"[Long] before those [who now deny resur­rection] did Noah’s people give the lie to this truth, and [so did] the folk of Ar-Rass, and [the tribes of] Thamud","4643":"and Ad, and Pharaoh, and Lot’s brethren,","4644":"and the dwellers of the wooded dales [of Madyan], and the people of Tubba: they all gave the lie to the apostles - and thereupon that whereof I had warned [them] came true.","4645":"Could We, then, be [thought of as being] worn out by the first creation?

able to bring the dead back to life?","5592":"HAS THERE [not] been an endless span of time before man [appeared - a time] when he was not yet a thing to be thought of?","5593":"Verily, it is We who have created man out of a drop of sperm intermingled, so that We might try him [in his later life]: and therefore We made him a being endowed with hearing and sight.","5594":"Verily, We have shown him the way: [and it rests with him to prove himself] either grateful or ungrateful.","5595":"[Now,] behold, for those who deny the truth We have readied chains and shackles, and a blazing flame","5596":"[whereas,] behold, the truly virtuous shall drink from a cup flavoured with the calyx of sweet-smelling flowers:","5597":"a source [of bliss] whereof God's servants shall drink, seeing it flow in a flow abundant.","5598":"[The truly virtuous are] they [who] fulfil their vows, and stand in awe of a Day the woe of which is bound to spread far and wide,","5599":"and who give food - however great be their own want of it - unto the needy, and the orphan, and the captive,","5600":"[saying, in their hearts,] \"We feed you for the sake of God alone: we desire no recompense from you, nor thanks:","5601":"behold, we stand in awe of our Sustainer's judgment on a distressful, fateful Day!\"","5602":"And so, God will preserve them from the woes of that Day, and will bestow on them brightness and joy,","5603":"and will reward them for all their patience in adversity with a garden [of bliss] and with [garments of] silk.","5604":"In that [garden] they will on couches recline, and will know therein neither [burning] sun nor cold severe,","5605":"since its [blissful] shades will come down low over them, and low will hang down its clusters of fruit, most easy to reach.","5606":"And they will be waited upon with vessels of silver and goblets that will [seem to] be crystal –","5607":"crystal-like, [but] of silver - the measure whereof they alone will determine.","5608":"And in that [paradise] they will be given to drink of a cup flavoured with ginger,","5609":"[derived from] a source [to be found] therein, whose name is \"Seek Thy Way\".","5610":"And immortal youths will wait upon them: when thou seest them, thou wouldst deem them to be scattered pearls;","5611":"and when thou seest [anything that is] there thou wilt see [only] bliss and a realm transcendent","5612":"Upon those [blest] will be garments of green silk and brocade;

acceptance!\"","5614":"VERILY, [O believer,] it is We who have bestowed from on high this Qur’an upon thee, step by step - truly a bestowal from on high!","5615":"Await, then, in all patience thy Sustainer's judgment, and pay no heed to any of them, who is a wilful sinner or an ingrate;","5616":"and bear in mind thy Sustainer's name at morn and evening","5617":"and during some of the night, and prostrate thyself before Him, and extol His limitless glory throughout the long night.","5618":"Behold, they [who are unmindful of God] love this fleeting life, and leave behind them [all thought of] a grief-laden Day.","5619":"[They will not admit to themselves that] it We who have created them and strengthened their make - and [that] if it be Our will We can replace them entirely with others of their kind.","5620":"VERILY, all this is an admonition: whoever, then, so wills, may unto his Sustainer find a way.","5621":"But you cannot will it unless God wills [to show you that way]: for, behold, God is indeed all-seeing, wise.","5622":"He admits unto His grace everyone who wills [to be admitted]; but as for the evildoers - for them has He readied grievous suffering [in the life to come].","5623":"CONSIDER these [messages,] sent forth in waves","5624":"and then storming on with a tempest's force!","5625":"Consider these [messages] that spread [the truth] far and wide,","5626":"thus separating [right and wrong] with all clarity,","5627":"and then giving forth a reminder,","5628":"[promising] freedom from blame or [offering] a warning!","5629":"BEHOLD, all that you are told to expect will surely come to pass.","5630":"Thus, [it will come to pass] when the stars are effaced,","5631":"and when the sky is rent asunder,","5632":"and when the mountains are scattered like dust,","5633":"and when all the apostles are called together at a time appointed...","5634":"For what day has the term [of all this] been set?","5635":"For the Day of Distinction [between the true and the false]!","5636":"And what could make thee conceive what that Day of Distinction will be?","5637":"Woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth!","5638":"Did We not destroy [so many of] those [sinners] of olden days?","5639":"And We shall let them be followed by those of later times:","5640":"[for] thus do We deal with such as are lost in sin.","5641":"Woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth!","5642":"Did We not create you out of a humble fluid","5643":"which We then let remain in [the womb's] firm keeping","5644":"for a term pre-ordained?","5645":"Thus have We determined [the nature of man's creation]: and excellent indeed is Our power to determine [what is to be]!","5646":"Woe, on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth!","5647":"Have We not caused the earth to hold within itself","5648":"the living and the dead?","5649":"and have We not set on it proud, firm mountains, and given you sweet water to drink?","5650":"Woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth!","5651":"GO ON towards that [resurrection] which you were wont to call a lie!","5652":"Go on towards the threefold shadow","5653":"that will offer no [cooling] shade and will be of no avail against the flame","5654":"which – behold!- will throw up sparks like [burning] logs,","5655":"like giant fiery ropes!","5656":"Woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth –","5657":"that Day on which they will not [be able to] utter a word,","5658":"nor be allowed to proffer excuses!","5659":"Woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth –","5660":"that Day of Distinction [between the true and the false, when they will be told]: \"We have brought you together with those [sinners] of olden times;","5661":"and if you [think that you] have a subterfuge left, try to outwit Me!\"","5662":"Woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth!","5663":"[AS AGAINST this,] behold, the God-conscious shall dwell amidst [cooling] shades and springs,","5664":"and [partake of] whatever fruit they may desire;","5665":"[and they will be told:] \"Eat and drink in good cheer in return for what you did [in life]!\"","5666":"Thus, behold, do We reward the doers of good;","5667":"[but] woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth!","5668":"EAT [your fill] and enjoy your life for a little while, O you who are lost in sin!","5669":"[But] woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth,","5670":"and when they are told, \"Bow down [before God]\", do not bow down:","5671":"woe on that Day unto those who give the to the truth!","5672":"In what other tiding, then, will they, after this, believe?","5673":"ABOUT WHAT do they [most often] ask one another?","5674":"About the awesome tiding [of resurrection],","5675":"on which they [so utterly] disagree.","5676":"Nay, but in time they will come to understand [it]!","5677":"And once again: Nay, but in time they will come to understand!","5678":"HAVE WE NOT made the earth a resting-place [for you],","5679":"and the mountains [its] pegs?","5680":"And We have created you in pairs;","5681":"and We have made your sleep [a symbol of] death","5682":"and made the night [its] cloak","5683":"and made the day [a symbol of] life.","5684":"And We have built above you seven firmaments,","5685":"and have placed [therein the sun,] a lamp full of blazing splendour.","5686":"And from the wind-driven clouds We send down waters pouring in abundance,","5687":"so that We might bring forth thereby grain, and herbs,","5688":"and gardens dense with follage.","5689":"VERILY, the Day of Distinction [between the true and the false] has indeed its appointed time:","5690":"the Day when the trumpet [of resurrection] is sounded and you all come forward in multitudes;","5691":"and when the skies are opened and become [as wide-flung] gates;","5692":"and when the mountains are made to vanish as if they had been a mirage.","5693":"[On that Day,] verily, hell will lie in wait [for those who deny the truth] –","5694":"a goal for all who are wont to transgress the bounds of what is right!","5695":"In it shall they remain for a long time.","5696":"Neither coolness shall they taste therein nor any [thirst-quenching] drink –","5697":"only burning despair and ice-cold darkness:","5698":"a meet requital [for their sins]!","5699":"Behold, they were not expecting to be called to account,","5700":"having given the lie to Our messages one and all:","5701":"but We have placed on record every single thing [of what they did].","5702":"[And so We shall say:] \"Taste, then, [the fruit of your evil doings,] for now We shall bestow on you nothing but more and more suffering!\"","5703":"[But,] verily for the God-conscious there is supreme fulfilment in store:","5704":"luxuriant gardens and vinyards,","5705":"and splendid companions well matched,","5706":"and a cup [of happiness] overflowing.","5707":"No empty talk will they hear in that [paradise], nor any lie.","5708":"[All this will be] a reward from thy Sustainer, a gift in accordance with [His Own] reckoning –","5709":"[a reward from] the Sustainer of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, the Most Gracious! [And] none shall have it in their power to raise their voices unto Him","5710":"on the Day when all [human] souls and all the angels will stand up in ranks: none will speak but he to whom the Most Gracious will have given leave; and [everyone] will say [only] what is right.","5711":"That will be the Day of Ultimate Truth: whoever wills, then, let him take the path that leads towards his Sustainer!","5712":"Verily, We have warned you of suffering near at hand - [suffering] on the Day when man shall [clearly] see what his hands have sent ahead, and when he who has denied the truth shall say, \"Oh, would that I were mere dust...!\"","5713":"CONSIDER those [stars] that rise only to set,","5714":"and move [in their orbits] with steady motion,","5715":"and float [through space] with floating serene,","5716":"and yet overtake [one another] with swift overtaking:","5717":"and thus they fulfil the [Creator's] behest!","5718":"[HENCE, think of] the Day when a violent convulsion will convulse [the world],","5719":"to be followed by further [convulsions]!","5720":"On that Day will [men's] hearts be throbbing,","5721":"[and] their eyes downcast...","5722":"[And yet,] some say, \"What! Are we indeed to be restored to our former state –","5723":"even though we may have become [a heap of] crumbling bones?\"","5724":"[And] they add, \"That, then, would be a return with loss!\"","5725":"[But,] then, that [Last Hour] will be [upon them of a sudden, as if it were] but a single accusing cry -","5726":"and then, lo, they will be fully awakened [to the truth]!","5727":"HAS THE STORY of Moses ever come within thy ken.","5728":"Lo! His Sustainer called out to him in the twice-hallowed valley:","5729":"\"Go unto Pharaoh - for, verily, he has transgressed all bounds of what is right -","5730":"and say [unto him], 'Art thou desirous of attaining to purity?","5731":"[If so,] then I shall guide thee towards [a cognition of] thy Sustainer, so that [henceforth] thou wilt stand in awe [of Him].’\"","5732":"And thereupon he [went to Pharaoh and] made him aware of the great wonder [of God's grace].","5733":"But [Pharaoh] gave him the lie and rebelliously rejected [all guidance],","5734":"and brusquely turned his back [on Moses];","5735":"and then he gathered [his great ones], and called [unto his people],","5736":"and said, \"I am your Lord All-Highest!\"","5737":"And thereupon God took him to task, [and made him] a warning example in the life to come as well as in this world.","5738":"In this, behold, there is a lesson indeed for all who stand in awe [of God].","5739":"[O MEN!] Are you more difficult to create than the heaven which He has built?","5740":"High has He reared its vault and formed it in accordance with what it was meant to be;","5741":"and He has made dark its night and brought forth its light of day.","5742":"And after that, the earth: wide has He spread its expanse,","5743":"and has caused its waters to come out of it, and its pastures,","5744":"and has made the mountains firm:","5745":"[all this] as a means of livelihood for you and your animals.","5746":"AND SO, when the great overwhelming event [of, resurrection] comes to pass –","5747":"on that Day man will [clearly] remember all that he has ever wrought;","5748":"and the blazing fire [of hell] will be lad open before all who [are destined to] see it.","5749":"For, unto him who shall have transgressed the bounds of what is right,","5750":"and preferred the life of this world [to the good of his soul],","5751":"that blazing fire will truly be the goal!","5752":"But unto him who shall have stood in fear of his Sustainer's Presence, and held back his inner self from base desires,","5753":"paradise will truly be the goal!","5754":"THEY WILL ASK thee [O Prophet] about the Last Hour: \"When will it come to pass?\"","5755":"[But] how couldst thou tell anything about it,","5756":"[seeing that] with thy Sustainer alone rests the beginning and the end [of all knowledge] thereof?","5757":"Thou art but [sent] to warn those who stand in awe of it.","5758":"On the Day when they behold it, [it will seem to them] as if they had tarried [in this world] no longer than one evening or [one night, ending with] its morn!","5759":"HE FROWNED and turned away","5760":"because the blind man approached him!","5761":"Yet for all thou didst know, [O Muhammad,] he might perhaps have grown in purity,","5762":"or have been reminded [of the truth], and helped by this reminder.","5763":"Now as for him who believes himself to be self-sufficient","5764":"to him didst thou give thy whole attention,","5765":"although thou art not accountable for his failure to attain to purity;","5766":"but as for him who came unto thee full of eagerness","5767":"and in awe [of God]","5768":"him didst thou disregard!","5769":"NAY, VERILY, these [messages] are but a reminder:","5770":"and so, whoever is willing may remember Him","5771":"in [the light of His] revelations blest with dignity,","5772":"lofty and pure,","5773":"[borne] by the hands of messengers","5774":"noble and most virtuous.","5775":"[But only too often] man destroys himself: how stubbornly does he deny the truth!","5776":"[Does man ever consider] out of what substance [God] creates him?","5777":"Out of a drop of sperm He creates him, and thereupon determines his nature,","5778":"and then makes it easy for him to go through life;","5779":"and in the end He causes him to die and brings him to the grave;","5780":"and then, if it be His will, He shall raise him again to life,","5781":"Nay, but [man] has never yet fulfilled what He has enjoined upon him!","5782":"Let man, then, consider [the sources of] his food:","5783":"[how it is] that We pour down water, pouring it down abundantly;","5784":"and then We cleave the earth [with new growth], cleaving it asunder,","5785":"and thereupon We cause grain to grow out of it,","5786":"and vines and edible plants,","5787":"and olive trees and date-palms,","5788":"and gardens dense with foliage,","5789":"and fruits and herbage,","5790":"for you and for your animals to enjoy.","5791":"AND SO, when the piercing call [of resurrection] is heard","5792":"on a Day when everyone will [want to] flee from his brother,","5793":"and from his mother and father,","5794":"and from his spouse and his children:","5795":"on that Day, to every one of them will his own state be of sufficient concern.","5796":"Some faces will on that Day be bright with happiness,","5797":"laughing, rejoicing at glad tidings.","5798":"And some faces will on that Day with dust be covered,","5799":"with darkness overspread:","5800":"these, these will be the ones who denied the truth and were immersed in iniquity!","5801":"WHEN THE SUN is shrouded in darkness,","5802":"and when the stars lose their light,","5803":"and when the mountains are made to vanish,","5804":"and when she-camels big with young, about to give birth, are left untended,","5805":"and when all beasts are gathered together,","5806":"and when the seas boil over,","5807":"and when all human beings are coupled [with their deeds],","5808":"and when the girl-child that was buried alive is made to ask","5809":"for what crime she had been slain,","5810":"and when the scrolls [of men's deeds] are unfolded,","5811":"and when heaven is laid bare,","5812":"and when the blazing fire [of hell] is kindled bright,","5813":"and when paradise is brought into view:","5814":"[on that Day] every human being will come to know what he has prepared [for himself].","5815":"BUT NAY! I call to witness the revolving stars,","5816":"the planets that run their course and set,","5817":"and the night as it darkly falls,","5818":"and the morn as it softly breathes:","5819":"behold, this [divine writ] is indeed the [inspired] word of a noble apostle,","5820":"with strength endowed, secure with Him who in almightiness is enthroned","5821":"[the word] of one to be heeded, and worthy of trust!","5822":"For, this fellow-man of yours is not a madman:","5823":"he truly beheld [the angel - beheld] him on the clear horizon;","5824":"and he is not one to begrudge others the knowledge [of whatever has been revealed to him] out of that which is beyond the reach of human Perception.","5825":"Nor is this [message] the word of any satanic force accursed.","5826":"Whither, then, will you go?","5827":"This [message] is no less than a reminder to all mankind –","5828":"to everyone of you who wills to walk a straight way.","5829":"But you cannot will it unless God, the Sustainer of all the worlds, wills [to show you that way].","5830":"WHEN THE SKY is cleft asunder,","5831":"and when the stars are scattered,","5832":"and when the seas burst beyond their bounds,","5833":"and when the graves are overturned –","5834":"every human being will [at last] comprehend, what he has sent ahead and what he has held back [in this world].","5835":"O MAN! What is it that lures thee away from thy bountiful Sustainer,","5836":"who has created thee, and formed thee in accordance with what thou art meant' to be, and shaped thy nature in just proportions,","5837":"having put thee together in whatever form He willed [thee to have]?","5838":"Nay, [O men,] but you [are lured away from God whenever you are tempted to] give the lie to [God’s] Judgment!","5839":"And yet, verily, there are ever-watchful forces over you,","5840":"noble, recording,","5841":"aware of whatever you do!","5842":"Behold, [in the life to come] the truly virtuous: will indeed be in bliss,","5843":"whereas, behold, the wicked will indeed be in a blazing fire –","5844":"[a fire] which they shall enter on Judgment Day,","5845":"and which they shall not [be able to] evade.","5846":"And what could make thee conceive what that Judgment Day will be?","5847":"And once again: What could make thee conceive what that Judgment Day will be?","5848":"[It will be] a Day when no human being shall be of the least avail to another human being: for on that Day [it will become manifest that] all sovereignty is God's alone.","5849":"WOE UNTO THOSE who give short measure:","5850":"those who, when they are to receive their due from [other] people, demand that it be given in full –","5851":"but when they have to measure or weigh whatever they owe to others, give less than what is due!","5852":"Do they not know that they are bound to be raised from the dead","5853":"[and called to account] on an awesome Day –","5854":"the Day when all men shall stand before the Sustainer of all the worlds?","5855":"NAY, VERILY, the record of the wicked is indeed [set down] in a mode inescapable!","5856":"And what could make thee conceive what that that mode inescapable will be?","5857":"A record [indelibly] inscribed!","5858":"Woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth –","5859":"those who give the lie to the [coming of] Judgment Day:","5860":"for, none gives the lie to it but such as are wont to transgress against all that is [and are] immersed in sin:","5861":"[and so,] whenever Our messages are conveyed to them, they but say, \"Fables of ancient times!\"","5862":"Nay, but their hearts are corroded by all [the evil] that they were wont to do!","5863":"Nay, verily, from [the grace of] their Sustainer shall they on that Day be debarred;","5864":"and then, behold, they shall enter the blazing fire","5865":"and be told: \"This is the [very thing] to which you were wont to give the lie!\"","5866":"NAY, VERILY - the record of the truly virtuous is [set down] in a mode most lofty!","5867":"And what could make thee conceive what that mode most lofty will be?","5868":"A record [indelibly] inscribed,","5869":"witnessed~ by all who have [ever] been drawn close unto God.","5870":"Behold, [in the life to come] the truly virtuous will indeed be in bliss:","5871":"[resting on couches, they will look up [to God]:","5872":"upon their faces thou wilt see the brightness of bliss.","5873":"They will be given a drink of pure wine whereon the seal [of God] will have been set,","5874":"pouring forth with a fragrance of musk.

Their punishment shall not be lightened, nor shall they be helped.","94":"To Moses We gave the Book and after him We sent other Messengers. We gave (Prophet) Jesus, the son of Mary, veritable signs, and supported him with the Spirit of Purity (Gabriel).

Little is that they believe.","96":"And when a Book came to them from Allah confirming what was with them, while before that they used to pray for victory over the unbelievers when there came to them what they knew, they disbelieved him. Therefore, the curse of Allah be upon the unbelievers!","97":"Evil is that for which they have bartered away their souls, that they disbelieve what Allah has sent down, grudging that Allah should send down from His bounty to whom He chooses from His worshipers! They have incurred wrath over wrath. For the unbelievers there is a humiliating punishment.","98":"When it is said to them: 'Believe in what Allah has sent down' they reply: 'We believe in what was sent down to us' But they disbelieve in what is sent after it, although it is the truth, confirming their own Book.

Most of them do not believe.","108":"And now that a Messenger has come to them from Allah confirming what was with them, some of those to whom the Book was given reject the Book of Allah behind their backs, as though they knew nothing","109":"and follow what the devils recited over the Kingdom of Solomon. Solomon did not disbelieve, it is the devils who disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was sent down upon the angels Harut and Marut in Babylon. They did not teach anyone, until both had said: 'We have been sent as a trial; do not disbelieve' From them they learned how they might separate a husband and his wife. However, they did not harm anyone with it, except by the permission of Allah. Indeed, they learned what harms them and does not profit them, yet they knew that anyone who buys it would have no share in the Everlasting Life.

He who exchanges belief for disbelief has surely strayed from the Right Path.","116":"Many of the People of the Book wish they might turn you back as unbelievers after you have believed, in envy of their souls, after the truth has been clarified to them. So pardon and forgive until Allah brings His command. Allah is Powerful over everything.","117":"Establish your prayers and pay the obligatory charity.

Who are patient in misfortune and hardship and during the time of courage. Such are the truthful; such are the cautious.","185":"Believers, retaliation is decreed for you concerning the killed. A free (man) for a free (man), a slave for a slave, and a female for a female. He who is pardoned by his brother, let the ensuing be with kindness, and let the payment be with generosity. This is an alleviation from your Lord and mercy. He who transgresses thereafter shall have a painful punishment.","186":"O owners of minds, for you in retaliation is life, in order that you be cautious.","187":"Written for any of you when death arrives, if he leaves behind goods, is the will for his parents and relatives with kindness.

Allah knows that you have been deceiving yourselves. He has accepted and pardoned you. Therefore, you may now touch them and seek what Allah has ordained for you. Eat and drink until the white thread becomes clear to you from a black thread at the dawn. Then resume the fast till nightfall and do not touch them while you cleave to the mosques. These are the Bounds of Allah, do not come near them. As such He makes known His verses to people so that they will be cautious.","195":"Do not consume your wealth between you in falsehood; neither propose it to judges, in order that you sinfully consume a portion of the people's wealth, while you know.","196":"They question you about the crescents. Say: 'They are times fixed for people and for the pilgrimage' Righteousness does not consist in entering dwellings from the back. But righteousness is he who wardsoff (sin). Enter dwellings by their doors and fear Allah, so that you will prosper.","197":"Fight in the way of Allah those who fight against you, but do not aggress. Allah does not love the aggressors.","198":"Kill them wherever you find them. Drive them out of the places from which they drove you. Dissension is greater than killing.

And do not shave your heads until the offerings have reached their destination. But if any of you is ill or suffers from an ailment of the head (scalp), he must pay a ransom either by fasting or by the giving of charity, or by offering a sacrifice. When you are safe, then whosoever enjoys the visitation until the pilgrimage, let his offering be that which may be easy, but if he lacks the means, let him fast three days during the pilgrimage and seven when he has returned, that is, ten days in all.

Provide for them with fairness; the rich according to his means, and the restricted according to his.

We recite (them) to you in truth, for you (Prophet Muhammad) are one of the Messengers.","260":"Of these Messengers, We have preferred some above others. To some Allah spoke; and some He raised in rank. We gave (Prophet) Jesus, the son of Mary, clear signs and strengthened him with the Spirit of Purity (Gabriel). Had Allah willed, those who succeeded them would not have fought against one another after the clear verses came to them. But they differed among themselves; some believed, and others disbelieved. Yet had Allah willed, they would not have fought against one another.

Call to witness two witnesses of your men, if the two are not men, then a man and two women from the witnesses whom you approve; so that if one of the two errs, one of them will remind the other. Whenever witnesses are called upon they must not refuse, and do not be weary to write it down, be it small or large, together with its term.

He who disbelieves the verses of Allah indeed Allah is Swift in reckoning.","313":"If they argue with you, say: 'I have submitted my face to Allah and so have those who follow me' To those who have received the Book (Jews and Nazarenes) and to the ignorant, ask: 'Have you submitted yourselves to Allah' If they became Muslims they were guided, if they turn away, then your only duty is to warn them. Allah is watching over all His worshipers.","314":"Those who disbelieve the verses of Allah and slay the Prophets unjustly, and slay those who bid to justice give them the glad tidings of a painful punishment!","315":"Their works shall be annulled in this world and in the Everlasting Life, and there shall be none to help them.","316":"Have you not seen those who have received a portion of the Book being called to the Book of Allah, that it might judge between them, and some turned away, swerving aside.","317":"For they say: 'The Fire will not touch us except for a certain number of days' And the lies they forged have deluded them in their religion.","318":"How will it be when We gather them for a Day in which there is no doubt, when every soul will be given what it has earned and they will not be wronged?","319":"Say: 'O Allah, Owner of the Kingdom. You give the kingdom to whom You will, and take it away from whom You will, You exalt whom You will and abase whom You will. In Your Hand is good, You have power over all things.","320":"You cause the night to enter into the day, and the day to enter into the night. You bring forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living. You provide without reckoning to whom You will'","321":"The believers should not take the unbelievers as guides in preference to the believers he who does this does not belong to Allah in anything, unless you have a fear of them. Allah warns you to be cautious of Him, the arrival is to Allah.","322":"Say: 'Whether you hide what is in your hearts or reveal it, Allah knows it. He knows all that is in the heavens and earth and has power over all things'","323":"The Day that every soul shall find what it has done of good brought forward, and what it has done of evil, it will wish if there were only a far space between it and that (Day). Allah warns you to be wary of Him; and Allah is Gentle with His worshipers.","324":"Say (Prophet Muhammad): 'If you love Allah, follow me and Allah will love you, and forgive your sins. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful'","325":"Say: 'Obey Allah and the Messenger' But if they turn away, then truly, Allah does not love the unbelievers.","326":"Allah chose Adam and Noah, the House of Abraham and the House of Imran above all worlds.","327":"They were the offspring of one another. Allah is Hearing, and Knowing.","328":"(Remember) when the wife of 'Imran said: 'Lord, I have vowed to You in dedication that which is hidden inside me. Accept this from me. You are the Hearer, the Knower'","329":"And when she was delivered of her, she said: 'Lord, I have given birth to her, a female' Allah knew of what she had given birth the male is not like the female 'and I have called her Mary. Protect her and all her descendants from satan, the stoned one'","330":"Her Lord graciously accepted her. He made her grow with a fine upbringing and entrusted her to the care of Zachariah. Whenever Zachariah went to her in the sanctuary, he found that she had provision with her. 'Mary' he said, 'how does this come to you' 'It is from Allah' she answered. Truly, Allah provides whomsoever He will without reckoning.","331":"Thereupon Zachariah supplicated to his Lord, saying: 'Lord, give me from You a good offspring. You hear all prayers'","332":"And the angels called out to him when he was standing in the sanctuary worshipping, saying: 'Allah gives you glad tidings of John, who shall confirm a Word from Allah. He shall be a master and chaste, a Prophet and from the righteous'","333":"He said: 'Lord, how shall I have a son when I am overtaken by old age and my wife is barren' He said: 'Even so, Allah does what He will'","334":"He said: 'Lord, appoint for me a sign' He said: 'Your sign is that you shall not speak to people except by signs for three days' And remember your Lord abundantly, exalt Him in the evening and at the dawn'","335":"And when the angels said to Mary: 'Allah has chosen you and purified you. He has chosen you above all women of the worlds.","336":"Mary, be obedient to your Lord, prostrate and bow with those who bow'","337":"This is from the news of the unseen. We reveal it to you (Prophet Muhammad). You were not present when they cast their quills to see which of them should look after Mary, nor were you present when they were disputing.","338":"When the angels said: 'O Mary, Allah gives you glad tidings of a Word (Be) from Him, whose name is Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary. He shall be honored in this world and in the Everlasting Life and he shall be among those who are close.","339":"He shall speak to people in his cradle and when he is aged, and shall be among the righteous'","340":"'Lord' she said, 'how can I bear a child when no human being has touched me' He replied: 'Such is the Will of Allah. He creates whom He will. When He decrees a thing, He only says: \"Be,\" and it is.","341":"He will teach him the Book, the Wisdom, the Torah and the Gospel,","342":"to be a Messenger to the Children of Israel, (saying): \"I have come to you with a sign from your Lord. From clay, I will create for you the likeness of a bird. I shall breathe into it and by the permission of Allah, it shall be a bird. I shall heal the blind, and the leper, and raise the dead to life by the permission of Allah. I shall tell you what you ate and what you store in your houses. Surely, that will be a sign for you, if you are believers.","343":"Likewise confirming the Torah that has been before me and to make lawful to you some of the things you have been forbidden. I bring you a sign from your Lord, therefore, fear Allah and obey me.","344":"Allah is my Lord and your Lord, therefore, worship Him. This is the Straight Path\"'","345":"When (Prophet) Jesus felt their disbelief, he said: 'Who will be my helpers in the way of Allah' The disciples replied: 'We are the helpers of Allah. We believe in Allah. Bear witness that we are submitters (Muslims).","346":"Lord, we have believed in what You sent down and followed the Messenger. Write us among Your witnesses'","347":"They devised, and Allah devised. And Allah is the Best Devisor.","348":"Allah said' (Prophet) Jesus, I will take you to Me and will raise you to Me, and I will purify you from those who disbelieve. I will make your followers (who died before Prophet Muhammad) above those who disbelieve till the Day of Resurrection. Then, to Me you shall all return, and I shall judge between you as to that you were at variance.","349":"As for those who disbelieve, I will sternly punish them in this world and in the Everlasting Life, there shall be none to help them.","350":"As for those who believe and do good works, He will pay them their wages in full. Allah does not love the harmdoers.","351":"This, We recite to you of the verses and the Wise Remembrance.","352":"Truly, the likeness of (Prophet) Jesus with Allah, is as the likeness of Adam, He created him from dust then He said to him \"Be\" and he was.","353":"The truth is from your Lord, therefore, do not be among the doubters.","354":"Those who dispute with you concerning him after the knowledge has come to you, say: 'Come, let us gather our sons and your sons, our womenfolk and your womenfolk, ourselves and yourselves. Then let us humbly pray, so lay the curse of Allah upon the ones who lie'","355":"This is indeed the truthful narration. There is no god except Allah. It is Allah who is the Almighty, the Wise.","356":"If they turn away, Allah knows the evildoers.","357":"Say: 'People of the Book, let us come to a common word between us and you that we will worship none except Allah, that we will associate none with Him, and that none of us take others for lords besides Allah' If they turn away, say: 'Bear witness that we are Muslims'","358":"People of the Book, why do you dispute about Abraham when both the Torah and the Gospel were not sent down till after him? Have you no sense?","359":"Indeed, you have disputed about that which you have knowledge. Why then dispute about that of which you have no knowledge? Allah knows and you do not know.","360":"No, Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Nazarene. He was of pure faith, a submitter (Muslim). He was never of the idolaters.","361":"Surely, the people who are nearest to Abraham are those who followed him, and this Prophet (Muhammad), and those who believe. Allah is the Guardian of the believers.","362":"Some of the People of the Book wish to make you go astray, but they lead none astray except themselves, though they do not sense it.","363":"People of the Book! Why do you disbelieve the verses of Allah while you are witness?","364":"People of the Book! Why do you confound truth with falsehood, and knowingly hide the truth?","365":"Some of the People of the Book say: 'Believe in that which is sent down to those who believe at the beginning of the day and disbelieve at the end of it, so that they will return.","366":"Believe none except those who follow your own religion' Say: 'The true guidance is the Guidance of Allah that anyone should be given the like of what you have been given, or dispute with you before your Lord' Say: 'Bounty is in the Hand of Allah' He gives it to whomsoever He will. Allah is the Embracer, the Knower.","367":"He singles out for His Mercy whom He will. And Allah is of abundant bounty.","368":"Among the People of the Book there are some, who, if you trust him with a Qintar (98, 841. 6 lbs.), will return it to you, and there are others, who, if you trust him with a dinar will not hand it back unless you stand over him, for they say: 'As for the common people, they have no recourse to us' They say lies against Allah while they know.","369":"Rather, those who keep their promise and fear Allah Allah loves the cautious.","370":"Those who sell the promise of Allah and their own oaths for a little price shall have no share in the Everlasting Life. Allah will neither speak to them, nor look at them, nor purify them on the Day of Resurrection. Theirs shall be a painful punishment.","371":"And there is a sect among them who twist their tongues with the Book, so you will think it is from the Book, whereas it is not from the Book. They say: 'This is from Allah' whereas it is not from Allah. And they knowingly tell lies against Allah.","372":"No human to whom Allah has given the (Holy) Book, Judgement and Prophethood would say to the people: 'Be worshipers of me, other than Allah' But rather, 'Be of the Lord, for that you teach the Book, and in that you have studied'","373":"Nor would he order you to take the angels and the Prophets for lords, what, would he order you with disbelief after you were submitters (Muslims)!","374":"And when Allah took the covenant of the Prophets: 'That I have given you of the Book and Wisdom. Then there shall come to you a Messenger (Muhammad) confirming what is with you, you shall believe in him and you shall support him to be victorious, do you agree and take My load on this' They answered: 'We do agree' Allah said: 'Then bear witness, and I will be with you among the witnesses'","375":"Whosoever turns back after that, they are the transgressors.","376":"Are they seeking a religion other than that of Allah, and to Him whosoever is in the heavens and the earth has submitted willingly and unwillingly. To Him they shall be returned.","377":"Say: 'We believe in Allah and in what is sent down to us and in that which was sent down to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the tribes, and in that which was given to (Prophets) Moses and Jesus, and the Prophets from their Lord. We do not differentiate between any of them. To Him we are submitters (Muslims)'","378":"He who chooses a religion other than Islam, it will not be accepted from him, and in the Everlasting Life he will be among the losers.","379":"How shall Allah guide a people who lapse into disbelief after they believed and bore witness that the Messenger is true, and after receiving clear proofs! Allah does not guide the harmdoers.","380":"Those, their recompense shall be the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people","381":"there they shall live for ever. Their punishment shall not be lightened, nor shall they be given respite.","382":"Except those who afterwards repent and mend their ways, Allah is Forgiving and the Most Merciful.","383":"Indeed those who disbelieve after they have believed and increase in disbelief, their repentance shall not be accepted. These are those who are astray.","384":"As for those who disbelieve and die unbelievers, there shall be not accepted from anyone of them, the whole earth full of gold, if he would ransom himself thereby. Those, for them there is a painful punishment, and none shall help them.","385":"You shall not attain righteousness until you spend of what you love. Whatever you spend is known to Allah.","386":"All food was lawful to the Children of Israel except what Israel forbade himself before the Torah had been sent down. Say: 'Bring the Torah and recite it, if you are truthful'","387":"Those who after this invent lies about Allah are harmdoers.","388":"Say: 'Allah has said the truth. Follow the Creed of Abraham, he was of pure faith, and not an idolater'","389":"The first House ever to be built for people was that at Bakkah (Mecca) blessed and a guidance for the worlds.","390":"In it, there are clear signs; the station where Abraham stood. Whoever enters it let him be safe. Pilgrimage to the House is a duty to Allah for all who can make the journey. And whosoever disbelieves, Allah is Rich, independent of all the worlds.","391":"Say: 'People of the Book, why do you disbelieve the verses of Allah? Surely, Allah is witness to all that you do'","392":"Say: 'People of the Book, why do you bar he who believes from the Path of Allah and seek to make it crooked, when you yourselves are witnesses? Allah is not inattentive of what you do'","393":"Believers, if you obey a sect of those who were given the Book, they will turn you into unbelievers after you have believed.","394":"How can you disbelieve when the verses of Allah are recited to you and His Messenger is among you! He who holds fast to Allah shall be guided to the Straight Path.","395":"Believers, fear Allah as He should be feared, and do not die except as Muslims.","396":"And hold fast to the Bond of Allah, together, and do not scatter. Remember the Favor of Allah bestowed upon you when you were enemies, and how He united your hearts, so that by His Favor you became brothers. And how He saved you from the Pit of Fire when you were on the brink of it. And so Allah makes plain to you His verses, in order that you will be guided.","397":"Let there be one nation of you that shall call to righteousness, ordering honor, and forbidding dishonor. Those are the prosperous.","398":"Do not follow the example of those who became divided and differed with one another after clear proofs had come to them. For those, there is a great punishment.","399":"The Day when faces will be whitened and faces blackened. To those whose faces have become blackened it will be said: 'Did you disbelieve after you had believed? Then taste the punishment for that you disbelieved'","400":"As for those whose faces will be whitened, they shall be in the Mercy of Allah for ever.","401":"Such are the verses of Allah, We recite them to you with truth. Allah does not want injustice for the worlds.","402":"To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. To Him all matters shall return.","403":"You are the best nation ever to be brought forth for people. You order honor and forbid dishonor, and you believe in Allah. Had the People of the Book believed, it would have surely been better for them. Some of them are believers, but most of them are evildoers.","404":"They will not harm you except a little hurt. And if they fight against you, they will turn their backs. Then they will not be victorious.","405":"Abasement shall be pitched upon them wherever they are found, except they are in a bond from Allah, and a bond of the people. They have incurred theAnger of Allah and have been humiliated, because they disbelieved the verses of Allah and unjustly slew His Prophets and because they disobeyed and were transgressors.","406":"Yet they are not all alike. There are among the People of the Book an upstanding nation that recite the verses of Allah (the Koran) throughout the night and prostrate themselves,","407":"who believe in Allah and the Last Day, who order honor and forbid dishonor and race in good works. These are the righteous.","408":"Whatever good they do, for them it shall not be denied. Allah knows the cautious.","409":"As for those who disbelieve, neither their riches nor their children shall help them a thing from Allah. They are the people of the Fire, and there they shall remain for ever.","410":"The wealth they spend in this worldly life is like a freezing wind that smites the harvest of a people who have wronged themselves and destroys it. Allah has not wronged them, but they wronged themselves.","411":"Believers, do not take intimates with other than your own. They spare nothing to ruin you, they yearn for you to suffer. Hatred has already shown itself from their mouths, and what their chests conceal is yet greater. Indeed, We have made clear to you the signs, if you understand.","412":"There you are loving them, and they do not love you. You believe in the entire Book. When they meet you they say: 'We, believe' But when alone, they bite their fingertips at you out of rage. Say: 'Die in your rage! Allah has knowledge of what is in your chests'","413":"When you are touched with good fortune, they grieve, but when evil befalls you, they rejoice. If you are patient and cautious, their guile will never harm you. Allah encompasses what they do.","414":"And when you went out at dawn from your family to lodge the believers in their positions for the battle. Allah is Hearing, Knowing.","415":"Two parties of you were about to fail, though Allah was their Guardian, and in Allah believers put all their trust.","416":"And Allah most assuredly helped you at Badr when you were humiliated. Therefore, fear Allah, in order that you will give thanks to Him.","417":"When you said to the believers: 'Is it not enough for you that your Lord should reinforce you with three thousand angels sent down upon you?","418":"Rather, if you have patience and are cautious, and they suddenly come against you, your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand marked angels'","419":"Allah did not make this to be except as glad tidings for you, so that your hearts might be comforted. Victory comes only from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise.","420":"And that He might cut off a part of those who disbelieve or suppress them, so that they will turn back, disappointed.","421":"No part of the matter is yours whether He turns towards them or punishes them. They are harmdoers.","422":"To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. He forgives whom He will and punishes whom He will. Allah is Forgiving, the Most Merciful.","423":"Believers, do not consume usury, doubled and redoubled, and fear Allah, in order that you shall prosper.","424":"Guard yourselves against the Fire prepared for unbelievers.","425":"Obey Allah and the Messenger in order to be subjected to mercy.","426":"And hasten to a forgiveness from your Lord and a Paradise as wide as heaven and earth, prepared for the cautious","427":"who spend in prosperity and in adversity, for those who curb their anger and those who forgive people. And Allah loves the charitable","428":"and those who, if they commit indecency or wrong themselves remember Allah and ask forgiveness of their sins for who but Allah forgives sins and those who do not persist in what they do while they know.","429":"Those, their recompense is forgiveness from their Lord and Gardens underneath which rivers flow, where they shall live for ever. How excellent is the wage of those who labor.","430":"There have been examples before you. Journey in the land and see what was the fate of the liars.","431":"This is a declaration to the people, a guidance and an admonition to the cautious.","432":"Do not be weak, neither sorrow while you are the upper ones, if you are believers.","433":"If a wound touches you, a similar wound already has touched the nation. Such days We alternate between the people so that Allah knows those who believe, and that He will take witnesses from among you, for Allah does not love the harmdoers,","434":"and so that Allah will examine those who believe and efface the unbelievers.","435":"Did you suppose that you would enter Paradise without Allah knowing those of you who struggled and who were patient?","436":"You used to wish for death before you met it, so you have seen it while you were looking.","437":"Muhammad is not except a Messenger; Messengers have passed away before him. If he dies or is killed, will you turn about on your heels? And he who turns on his heels will not harm Allah a thing. Allah will recompense the thankful.","438":"It is not for any soul to die except by the permission of Allah a postponed book and he who desires the reward of this world, We shall give him of it, and he who desires the reward of the Everlasting Life, We shall give him of it. And We will recompense the thankful.","439":"There has been many a Prophet with whom many of the Lord have fought and they did not faint when they were smitten in the way of Allah, neither did they weaken, nor did they humble themselves, and Allah loves the patient.","440":"Their only words were: 'Lord, forgive us our sins and that we exceeded in our affair, make us firm of foot and give us victory over the unbelievers'","441":"And Allah gave them the reward of this life, and the best reward of the Everlasting Life. Allah loves the gooddoers.","442":"Believers, if you obey those who disbelieve they will turn you upon your heels and you will turn to be losers.","443":"But Allah is your Sponsor. He is the Best of victors.","444":"We will throw terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. For that they have associated with Allah that which He did not send down for a proof. Fire shall be their home, evil indeed is the dwellingplace of the harmdoers.","445":"Allah has been true in His promise towards you when you routed them by His leave, until you lost heart, and quarreled about the matter, and disobeyed, afterHe had shown you that which you loved. Some among you wanted the world, and some among you wanted the Everlasting Life. Then He made you turn away from them in order to test you. But He has forgiven you, for Allah is Bounteous to the believers.","446":"And when you were going up, and paid no heed for anyone, and the Messenger was calling you from behind; so He rewarded you with grief upon grief that you might not sorrow for what escaped you neither for what smote you. And Allah is Aware of what you do.","447":"Then, after sorrow, He sent down upon you safety. Slumber overtook a party, while another party cared only for themselves, thinking of Allah thoughts that were not true, the guess of ignorance, saying: 'Have we any say in the affair' Say: 'The entire affair belongs to Allah' They conceal in themselves what they do not disclose to you. They say: 'If we had any say in the affair we should not have been killed here' Say: 'Had you stayed in your homes, those of you for whom slaying was written would have come out to their (death) beds so that Allah might try what was in your chests and that He will examine what is in your hearts' And Allah knows the innermost of the chests.","448":"Those of you who turned away on the day when the two armies met must have been seduced by satan on account of some of what they had earned. But Allah has pardoned them. He is Forgiving and Clement.","449":"Believers, do not be as those who disbelieve and say of their brothers when they journey in the land or go of to battle: 'Had they stayed with us, they would not have died, nor would they have been killed' In order that Allah will make that a regret in their hearts. Allah revives and causes to die. He has knowledge of what you do.","450":"If you should be killed in the way of Allah or die, the Forgiveness and Mercy from Allah would surely be better than all you amass.","451":"And if you die or are killed, before Allah you shall all be gathered.","452":"It was by that Mercy of Allah that you (Prophet Muhammad) dealt so leniently with them. Had you been harsh and hardhearted, they would have surely deserted you. Therefore, pardon them and ask forgiveness for them. Take counsel with them in the matter and when you are resolved, put your trust in Allah. Allah loves those who trust.","453":"If Allah helps you, none can overcome you. If He forsakes you, who then can help you after Him? Therefore, in Allah let the believers put all their trust.","454":"It is not for a Prophet to defraud, whosoever defrauds shall bring that fraud on the Day of Resurrection. Then, every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned, and they shall not be wronged.","455":"Is he who follows the pleasure of Allah like he who is laden with the Anger of Allah, Gehenna (Hell) shall be his shelter. Evil shall be his return!","456":"They are in ranks with Allah. Allah sees what they do.","457":"Allah has surely been gracious to the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from themselves to recite to them His verses, to purify them, and to teach them the Book and the Wisdom (prophetic sayings), though before that they were in clear error.","458":"Why, when an affliction hits you and that you had yourselves inflicted twice the like of it, you said: 'How is this' Say: 'This is from your own selves' Surely, Allah has power over all things.","459":"What hit you the day the two armies met was by the permission of Allah, so that He might know the believers","460":"and that He might know the hypocrites' When it was said to them: 'Come, fight or repel in the way of Allah' They replied: 'If only we knew how to fight, we would follow you' On that day, they were nearer to disbelief than belief. They said with their mouths what was not in their hearts. And Allah knows what they hide.","461":"Who said to their brothers and they themselves had stayed behind 'Had they obeyed us, they would not have been killed' Say to them: 'Avert death from yourselves then, if what you say is true'","462":"You must not think that those who were killed in the way of Allah are dead. But rather, they are alive with their Lord and have been provided for,","463":"rejoicing in the Bounty that Allah has given to them and having glad tidings in those who remain behind and have not joined them, for no fear shall be on them neither shall they sorrow,","464":"having glad tidings of a Favor and Bounty from Allah. Allah will not waste the wage of the believers.","465":"Those who answered Allah and the Messenger after the wound had afflicted them, for those of them who did good and were cautious there is a great wage.","466":"Those to whom the people said: 'The people have gathered against you, therefore fear them' but it increased them in belief and they said: 'Allah is Sufficient for us. He is the Best Guardian'","467":"So, they returned with the Favor and Bounty of Allah so evil did not touch them. They followed the pleasure of Allah, and Allah is of Great Bounty.","468":"That is satan frightening those whom he sponsored. So do not fear them, and fear Me, if you are believers.","469":"Do not let those who race in disbelief sadden you. They will not harm Allah a thing. Allah does not want to give them a share in the Everlasting Life. For them is a great punishment.","470":"Those who buy disbelief with belief will not harm Allah a thing, for them there is a painful punishment!","471":"Do not let those who disbelieve think that what We delay is better for them. Indeed, We delay for them only that they will increase in sin, and for them a humiliating punishment.","472":"Allah will not leave the believers in that which you are till He shall distinguish the evil from the good. Allah will not let you see the unseen. But Allah chooses from His Messengers whom He will. Therefore, believe in Allah and His Messengers, for if you believe and are cautious there shall be for you a great wage.","473":"And do not let those who are greedy with what Allah has given them of His Bounty think it is better for them, but rather, it is worse for them. They will be coiled in that which they were greedy on the Day of Resurrection. And to Allah belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is Aware of what you do.","474":"Allah has heard the saying of those who said: 'Allah is poor, but we are rich' We will write down what they have said, and their slaying of the Prophets without right. And We shall say: 'Taste the punishment of the burning'","475":"That, is for what your hands have forwarded. And Allah is never unjust to His worshipers.","476":"Those (the Jews) who say: 'Allah has promised us that we do not believe in a Messenger unless he brings to us an offering that fire consumes' Say: 'Indeed Messengers have come to you before me with clear proofs and with that of which you spoke. Why did you kill them, if what you say is true'","477":"If they belie you (Prophet Muhammad), indeed other Messengers before you were belied who came with clear proofs, and the Psalms, and the Illuminating Book.","478":"Every soul shall taste death. You shall be paid your wages in full on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever is removed from Hell and is admitted to Paradise shall prosper, for the worldly life is nothing but the enjoyment of delusion.","479":"You shall be tried in your wealth and yourselves, and you shall hear much hurt from those who were given the Book before you, and from those who are idolaters. But if you are patient and cautious, surely, that is of the firm affairs.","480":"When Allah took a covenant with those to whom the Book was given, (saying): 'You shall make it clear to the people, and not conceal it. 'But they threw it behind their backs and they bought with it a little price. Evil was what they bought.","481":"Do not think that those who rejoice in what they have brought and love to be praised for what they have not done do not think they will be secure from the punishment. And for them there is a painful punishment.","482":"To Allah belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth. Allah has Power over all things.","483":"Surely, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, there are signs for those with minds.","484":"Those who remember Allah when standing, sitting, and on their sides, and contemplate upon the creation of the heavens and the earth (saying:) 'Lord, You have not created these in falsehood. Exaltations to You! Guard us against the punishment of the Fire.","485":"Our Lord, whomsoever You admit into the Fire, You will have abased, and the harmdoers shall have no helpers.","486":"Our Lord, we have heard the caller calling to belief, \"Believe in your Lord!\" So we believe. Our Lord, forgive us our sins and acquit us of our evil deeds, and take us to You in death with the righteous.","487":"Our Lord, give us what You promised us by Your Messengers, and do not abase us on the Day of Resurrection. You do not break Your promise'","488":"And indeed their Lord answers them: 'I do not waste the labor of any that labors among you, male or female you are from each other. And those who emigrated, and were expelled from their houses, those who suffered hurt in My way, and fought, and were killed those I shall surely acquit of their evil deeds, and I shall admit them to Gardens underneath which rivers flow' A reward from Allah, and Allah with Him is the best reward.","489":"Do not let the coming and going in the land of those who disbelieve delude you;","490":"a little enjoyment, then, their shelter is in Gehenna (Hell), an evil cradling.","491":"But for those who fear their Lord, for them shall be Gardens underneath which rivers flow, there they shall live for ever, a (goodly) hosting from Allah, and that which is with Allah is better for the righteous.","492":"There are some among the People of the Book who believe in Allah, and in what has been sent down to you, and what has been sent down to them, humble to Allah and do not buy with the verses of Allah a little price. Those, their wage shall be with their Lord. Allah is Swift at reckoning.","493":"Believers, be patient, and race in patience, be steadfast, fear Allah, in order that you will be victorious.","494":"O people, fear your Lord, who created you from a single soul. From it He created its spouse, and from both of them scattered many men and women. Fear Allah, by whom you ask one another, and (fear) the wombs (lest you sever its relationship). Allah is ever watching over you.","495":"Give the orphans their wealth. Do not exchange the evil for the good, nor consume their wealth with your wealth. Surely, that is a great sin.","496":"If you fear that you cannot act justly towards the orphans, then marry such women as seem good to you; two, three, four of them. But if you fear that you cannot do justice, then one only, or, those you possess. It is likelier then that you will not be partial.","497":"Give women their dowries freely, but if they are pleased to offer you any of it, consume it good and smooth.","498":"Do not give the (orphaned) fools your wealth with which Allah has entrusted you for (their) support, and provide for them and clothe them from it, and speak to them with kind words.","499":"And test the orphans until they reach (the age of) marriage. If you perceive in them right judgment, hand over to them their wealth, and do not consume it wastefully, nor hastily before they are grown. And whosoever is rich let him abstain, if poor, let him consume with kindness. When you hand over to them their wealth, take witness over them; it is sufficient that Allah is the Reckoner.","500":"Men shall have a share in what their parents and kinsmen leave, and women shall have a share in what their parents and kinsmen leave, whether it is little or abundant, it is an obligated share.","501":"If relatives, orphans, or the needy are present at the division (of the inheritance), provide for them out of it, and speak to them in kind words.","502":"And let them fear, who, if they themselves left behind weak offspring, would be afraid for them, and let them fear Allah and speak exactly.","503":"Those who consume the wealth of orphans wrongfully, only consume fire in their bellies, and they shall roast in the Blaze.","504":"Allah charges you concerning your children, for a male like the share of two females. If they are women, above two, they shall have two thirds of what he left, but if she is one, then to her a half. While for his parents, to each one of the two a sixth of what he left, if he has a child. But if he has no child and his heirs are his parents, his mother shall have a third. If he has siblings, to his mother a sixth after any bequest he had bequeathed, or any debt. Your fathers and your children, you do not know which of them is nearer in benefit to you. This is an obligation from Allah. Surely, Allah is the Knower, the Wise.","505":"For you half of what your wives leave if they have no child. If they have a child, a quarter of what they leave shall be yours after any bequest she had bequeathed, or any debt. And for them (the females) they shall inherit one quarter of what you leave if you have no child. If you have a child, they shall inherit one eighth, after any bequest you had bequeathed, or any debt. If a man or a woman have no direct heirs, but have a brother or a sister, to each of the two a sixth. If they are more than that, they shall equally share the third, after any bequest that he had bequeathed or any debt without harm. This is an obligation from Allah. He is the Knower, the Clement.","506":"Such are the Bounds of Allah. He who obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him to Gardens underneath which rivers flow. That is a great wining.","507":"And he who disobeys Allah and His Messenger and transgresses His Bounds, He will admit him to a Fire and shall live in it for ever. For him, there is a humiliating punishment.","508":"If any of your women commit indecency, call in four witnesses from among yourselves against them, if they testify, confine them to their houses till death overtakes them or till Allah makes for them a way.","509":"If two among you commit it punish them both. If they repent and make amends, leave them alone. Allah is the Relenter, the Merciful.","510":"(Allah accepts) the repentance from only those who commit evil in ignorance and then quickly turn to Him in repentance. Allah will relent towards them. Allah is Knowing, Wise.","511":"(Allah will accept) no repentance from those who do evil deeds until death comes to one of them, he says: 'Now I repent' Nor those who die unbelieving. For those We have prepared a painful punishment.","512":"Believers, it is unlawful for you to inherit women forcefully, neither bar them, in order that you go off with part of what you have given them, except when they commit a clear indecency. Live with them honorably. If you hate them, it may be that you hate something which Allah has set in it much good.","513":"If you wish to take a wife in the place of another wife, and you have given to one a Qintar (98, 841. 6 lbs.) so do not take from it anything. What, will you take it by way of calumny and a clear sin!","514":"How can you take it back when you have reached one another (sexually) and they have taken from you a strong covenant!","515":"And do not marry women your fathers married unless it is a thing of the past surely that was an indecency, hated, and a way of evil.","516":"Forbidden to you are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your paternal aunts and maternal aunts, your brother's daughters, your sister's daughters, your mothers who have given suck to you, your suckling sisters, your wives mothers, and your stepdaughters who are in your care from your wives with whom you have lain, but if you have never lain with them it is no fault in you. (Also forbidden to you) are the wives of your sons who are of your loins, and to take to you two sisters together unless it is a thing of the past. Allah is the Forgiver and the Most Merciful.","517":"And (forbidden to you) are married women, except those whom your right hand owns. Such Allah has written for you. Lawful to you beyond all that, is that you can seek using your wealth in marriage and not fornication. So whatever you have enjoyed from them give them their obligated wage. And there is no fault in you in what ever you mutually agree after the obligation. Allah is the Knower, the Wise.","518":"If any one of you do not have the affluence to be able marry free believing women, (let him marry) from among the believing women that your right hand owns. Allah knows best your belief, you are from each other. Marry them with the permission of their people and give them their wages (dowry) honorably being women in marriage and chaste, not taking lovers. If, after marriage they commit adultery, they shall be liable to half the punishment of a married (free) woman. That is for those of you who fear fornication, but it is better for you to be patient. Allah is the Forgiver, the Most Merciful.","519":"Allah wishes to make this clear to you and to guide you along the ways of those who have gone before you, and turns towards you. And Allah is the Knower, the Wise.","520":"Allah wishes to turn towards you, but those who follow their lower desires wish you to greatly swerve away.","521":"Allah wishes to lighten for you (the jurisprudence), and humans are created weak.","522":"Believers, do not consume your wealth among yourselves in falsehood, except there be trading by your mutual agreement. And do not kill yourselves. Allah is the Most Merciful to you.","523":"But whosoever does that in transgression and wrongfully We shall roast him in the Fire. That is an easy matter for Allah.","524":"If you avoid the major sins that are forbidden to you, We shall pardon your evil deeds and admit you by an entrance of honor.","525":"Do not wish for the bounty which Allah has preferred one of you above another. For men is a share of what they earn, and for women is a share of what they earn. Ask Allah of His Bounty. Allah has knowledge of all things.","526":"To everyone we have made heirs of that which parents and kinsmen leave, and those with whom you have sworn an agreement, so give to them their share. Allah is Witness over everything.","527":"Men are the maintainers of women for that Allah has preferred in bounty one of them over another, and for that they have spent of their wealth. Righteous women are obedient, guarding in secret that which Allah has guarded. Those from whom you fear rebelliousness, admonish them and desert them in the bed and smack them (without harshness). Then, if they obey you, do not look for any way against them. Allah is High, Great.","528":"If you fear a breach between them send for an arbiter from his people and an arbiter from her people. If both wish reconciliation, Allah will bring success between them. Allah is the Knower, the Aware.","529":"Worship Allah and do not associate anything with Him. Be kind to parents and near kinsmen, to the orphans and to the needy, to your neighbor who is your kindred, and to the neighbor at your far side, and the companion at your side, and to the destitute traveler, and to that which your right hands owns. Allah does not love he who is proud and struts,","530":"(or) those who are greedy and order other people to be greedy, who themselves conceal the bounty that Allah has given them. And We have prepared a humiliating punishment for the unbelievers.","531":"And those who spend their wealth to showoff to people and neither believe in Allah nor in the Last Day. Whosoever has satan for a companion, he is an evil companion.","532":"What (harm) could befall them if they believed in Allah and the Last Day and spent of what Allah provided them with? Allah is Knowledgeable of them all.","533":"Surely, Allah shall not harm so much as the weight of an atom, and if it is a good deed He will double it, and give from His Own a great wage.","534":"How then shall it be when We bring forward from every nation a witness, and bring you (Prophet Muhammad) to witness against those!","535":"On that Day those who disbelieved, and have disobeyed the Messenger (Muhammad) will wish that the earth might be leveled with them, and they will not conceal a statement from Allah.","536":"Believers, do not come close to prayer when you are drunk, until you know what you are saying, nor when you are in a state of impurity, unless you are crossing through the way (prayer area) until you have bathed yourselves. If you are ill or on a journey, or if any of you comes from the toilet or you have touchedwomen, and you cannot find water, so touch pure dust and wipe your faces and your hands. Allah is the Pardoner, the Forgiver.","537":"Have you not seen those to whom a portion of the Book was given purchasing error and wishing that you should err from the Path?","538":"But Allah knows best your enemies. It is sufficient that Allah is the Guardian, and it is sufficient that Allah is the Helper.","539":"Some Jews tampered with the words (altering) their places saying: 'We have heard and we disobey' and 'Hear, without hearing' and 'Observe us (Ra'ina, in Hebrew means evil) ', twisting with their tongues traducing religion. But if they had said: 'We have heard and obey' and 'Hear' and 'Regard us' it would have been better for them, and more upright; but Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they do not believe, except a few.","540":"You, to whom the Book was given, believe in that which We have sent down confirming that which you have, before We obliterate faces and turn them on their backs, or curse them as We cursed the people of the Sabbath. And the command of Allah is done.","541":"Allah does not forgive (the sin of inventing an) association with Him, but He forgives other (sins) to whomsoever He will. He who associates with Allah has invented a great sin.","542":"Have you not seen those who exalt themselves? Rather, Allah purifies whom He will and they shall not be wronged a single tissue that covers a date stone.","543":"Look how they forge lies against Allah, and it is sufficient for a clear sin.","544":"Have you not seen those to whom a portion of the Book was given believing in (the two statutes of Mecca) jibt and taghout and say to those who disbelieve: 'Those are more guided on the way than those who believe.'","545":"Those are they whom Allah has cursed and whosoever Allah has cursed, you will not find any helper for him.","546":"Or, will they have a share in the Kingdom? If so, they will not give the people the pit mark of a date stone.","547":"Or do they envy people for the Bounty Allah has given them? We gave the family of Abraham the Book and Wisdom, and a great kingdom.","548":"There are some of them who believed in him (Prophet Muhammad), and some of them that bar from it, and Gehenna (Hell) is sufficient for a Blaze.","549":"Those who disbelieve Our verses We will roast them in a Fire! As often as their skins are cooked, We exchange their skin with another, in order that they taste the punishment. Surely, Allah is Mighty, the Wise.","550":"As for those who believe and do good works, We shall admit them to Gardens underneath which rivers flow, they are there for eternity, and for them purified spouses. And We shall admit them into plenteous shade.","551":"Allah orders you all to hand back trusts to their owners, and when you judge between people you judge with justice. Indeed, the best is the exhortation with which Allah exhorts you. Allah is the Hearer, the Seer.","552":"Believers, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. Should you dispute about anything refer it to Allah and the Messenger, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is better and the best interpretation.","553":"Have you not seen those who claim that they believe in what has been sent down to you and what was sent down before you? They desire to be judged by the idol, although they have been commanded to disbelieve it. But satan desires to lead them astray into far error.","554":"When it is said to them: 'Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger' you see the hypocrites completely barring the way to you.","555":"How would it be if some affliction hit them for what their hands have forwarded? Then, they would come to you swearing by Allah, 'We sought only kindness and conciliation'","556":"Those, Allah knows what is in their hearts, so turn away from them, and exhort them, and say to them penetrating words about themselves.","557":"We did not send a Messenger except that he should be obeyed, by the permission of Allah. If, when they wronged themselves, they had come to you and asked Allah for forgiveness, and the Messenger had asked for forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah the Turner, the Most Merciful.","558":"But no, by your Lord, they will not believe you until they make you the judge regarding the disagreement between them, then, they will not find in themselves any discomfort concerning your verdict, and will surrender to you in full submission.","559":"Had We written for them, saying, 'Slay yourselves' or 'Emerge from your houses' they would not have done so, except a few of them. Yet, if they had done as they were exhorted, it would have been better for them, and stronger in firmness,","560":"and then We would surely have given them from Our Own, a great wage,","561":"and guided them to a Straight Path.","562":"Whosoever obeys Allah, and the Messenger, they are with those whom Allah has favored, the Prophets, the sincere, the martyrs and the righteous, and these are the best company.","563":"This is the Bounty of Allah. It is sufficient that Allah is the Knowledgeable.","564":"Believers, take your precautions. March in detachments or march all together.","565":"Surely, there are among you, he who lingers, then, if an affliction hits you, he would say: 'Allah has favored me, that I was not a martyr with them'","566":"But, if the Bounty of Allah reaches you, he would surely say as if there had never been any affection between you and him: 'Would that I had been with them! I should have indeed won a great triumph'","567":"So let those who sell the worldly life for the Everlasting Life fight in the way of Allah, whoever fights in the way of Allah, and is killed or conquers, We shall give him a great wage.","568":"So why is it, that you do not fight in the way of Allah, and for the abased among men, women, and children who say: 'Our Lord, bring us out from this village whose people are harmdoers, and give to us a guardian from You, and give to us a helper from You.'","569":"And those who believe fight in the way of Allah, but those who disbelieve fight in the way of the idol. Therefore, fight against those guided by satan. Indeed, satan's guile is always weak.","570":"Have you not seen those to whom it has been said: 'Restrain your hands, establish your prayers and pay the obligatory charity' Then, as soon as fighting is written for them, there is a party of them fearing people as they would fear Allah, or with stronger fear. And they say: 'Our Lord, why have You written fighting for us, why not postpone us to a near term' Say: 'The pleasure of this life is little. The Everlasting Life is better for the cautious. You shall not be wronged a single tissue (of the fine skin that covers a date stone).","571":"Wherever you are, death will overtake you, even if you shall be in the fortified, high towers' If bounty reaches them, they say: 'This is from Allah' but when evil hits them, they say: 'This is from you' Say to them: 'All is from Allah' What is the matter with this people that they scarcely understand any statement.","572":"Whatever good reaches you, it is from Allah, and whatever evil reaches you, it is from yourself. We have sent you (Prophet Muhammad) as a Messenger to humanity. Allah is sufficient for a Witness.","573":"Whosoever obeys the Messenger, indeed he has obeyed Allah. As for those who turn away, We have not sent you to be their protector.","574":"They say, 'Obedience' but as soon as they leave you, a party of them hide other than what they said. Allah writes down what they hide. So turn away from them, and rely on Allah. Allah is sufficient for a Guardian.","575":"Will they not contemplate upon the Koran? If it had been from other than Allah, they would surely have found in it many contradictions.","576":"When a matter comes to them, be it of security or fear, they broadcast it, whereas if they returned it to the Messenger and to those in authority among them, those of them whose task is to research it would have known it. If it was not for the Bounty of Allah and His Mercy, all but a few of you would have followed satan.","577":"Therefore, fight in the way of Allah. You are only responsible for yourself. Urge the believers on, in order that Allah may restrain the might of those who disbelieve. Allah is stronger in might, and stronger in punishment.","578":"Whosoever intercedes with a good intercession shall receive a share of it, and whosoever intercedes with a bad intercession shall receive a portion of it. Allah has power over all things.","579":"And when you are greeted with a greeting, greet with better than it, or return it. Allah is the Reckoner of all things.","580":"Allah, there is no god except He. He will gather you to the Resurrection Day, there is no doubt in it. And who is truer in statement than Allah?","581":"What is the matter with you that you are two parties concerning the hypocrites when Allah has overthrown them for what they earned? Would you desire to guide those whom Allah has caused to be led astray? Whosoever Allah leads astray, you will not find for him a way.","582":"They wish that you would disbelieve as they disbelieve, and then you would be equal. Therefore, do not take a guide from them until they emigrate in the way of Allah. Then, if they turn back take them and kill them wherever you find them. Do not take them for guides or helpers,","583":"except those who join to a nation in which there is between you and them a treaty, or they come to you with their chests constricted from fighting you or fighting their nation. Had Allah willed, He would have given them power over you, and then they would have certainly fought you. Therefore, if they keep away from you and do not fight you, offering you peace, then Allah does not make any way for you against them.","584":"You will find others desiring to be secure from you, and secure from their own nation. Whenever they are called back to sedition, they plunge into it. If they do not keep away from you and offer you peace, and restrain their hands, take them and kill them wherever you find them. Those, over them, We give you clear authority.","585":"It is not for a believer to kill another believer, except that it is by error. Whosoever kills a believer in error, let him free a believing slave, and ransom is to be handed to his family, unless they forgo being charitable. If he belonged to a people who are your enemies and is a believer then, the setting free of a believing slave. If he belonged to a people in which there is between you and them a treaty, then a ransom is to be handed to his family and the setting free of a believing slave. But, if he does not find (the means) let him fast two consecutive months in repentance to Allah. And Allah is the Knower, the Wise.","586":"The recompense for he who kills a believer deliberately is Gehenna (Hell), he is eternal there. Allah will be angry with him and will curse him and prepare for him a great punishment.","587":"Believers, if you are journeying in the way of Allah, do not say to those who offer you peace, until it has been clarified: 'You are not believers' seeking the enjoyment of the worldly life, with Allah there are many spoils. You were like that before, and Allah has been gracious to you. Therefore let it be clarified. Surely, Allah is Aware of what you do.","588":"Believers who stay behind, having no injury, are not equal to those who fight in the way of Allah with their wealth and their souls. Allah has preferred those who fight with their wealth and their souls a degree above those who stay behind (because of sickness). Yet to each, Allah has promised the most excellent (Paradise). And Allah has preferred those who fought over those who stayed behind with a great wage.","589":"Ranks from Him, forgiveness and mercy. Allah is the Forgiver, the Most Merciful.","590":"And the angels who take those who wronged themselves will say: 'In what condition were you' They will reply 'We were oppressed in the land' They (the angels) will say: 'Was not the earth of Allah wide enough for you in order that you migrate in it' Those, their shelter will be Gehenna (Hell), an evil arrival.","591":"Except the men, women, and children, who, being abased have no means and they are unable to guide themselves to a way.","592":"Those, Allah may pardon them, He is the Pardoner, the Forgiver.","593":"Whosoever emigrates in the way of Allah shall find in the land numerous refuges and abundance. Whosoever leaves his house an immigrant to Allah and His Messenger and then death overtakes him, his wage shall have fallen upon Allah. Allah is the Forgiver, the Most Merciful.","594":"And when you are journeying in the land, there is no fault in you that you shorten the prayer if you fear that those who disbelieve will afflict you. Indeed, the unbelievers are a clear enemy for you.","595":"When you are with them, and establish the prayer, let a party of them stand with you, and let them take their weapons. After making their prostrations, let them be behind you, and let another party who have not prayed come and pray with you, taking their precautions and their weapons. Those who disbelieve wish that you should be inattentive of your weapons and your baggage, so that they might swoop upon you with one assault. But there is no fault in you if you are harmed by rain, or you are sick to lay aside your weapons, but take your precautions. Allah has prepared a humiliating punishment for the unbelievers.","596":"When you have established the prayer, remember Allah standing, sitting, and on your sides. Then, when you are secure, establish the prayer, surely, prayer is timely written upon the believer.","597":"And do not be weak in seeking out the people. If you are suffering, they are also suffering as you are suffering, but you are hoping from Allah that which they do not hope. Allah is the Knower, the Wise.","598":"Surely, We have sent down to you the Book with the truth, so that you will rule between the people by that Allah has shown you. So do not be an advocate for the traitors.","599":"And ask the forgiveness of Allah, surely Allah is the Forgiver, the Most Merciful.","600":"And do not argue on behalf of those who betray themselves, surely, Allah does not love the sinful traitor.","601":"They seek to hide themselves from the people, but they do not hide themselves from Allah for He is with them when they hide the saying that does not please Him. Allah encompasses what they do.","602":"There you are, you have argued on their behalf in the worldly life, but who will argue with Allah on their behalf on the Day of Resurrection! Or who will be a guardian for them?","603":"He who does evil or wrongs himself and then asks forgiveness of Allah will find that Allah is the Forgiver, the Most Merciful.","604":"Whosoever earns a sin, he only earns it against himself. Allah is the Knower, the Wise.","605":"Whosoever earns a fault or a sin and casts it upon the innocent, indeed, he bears the slander and a clear sin.","606":"But for the Favor of Allah to you (Prophet Muhammad) and His Mercy, a party of them intended to lead you astray, but they only lead themselves astray, and they did not harm you a thing. Allah has sent down to you the Book and the Wisdom and He has taught you what you did not know. The Bounty of Allah to you is ever great.","607":"There is no good in much of their confiding, except for he who bids to charity, honor, or reforms between people. Whosoever does that for the sake of the pleasure of Allah, We shall give him a great wage.","608":"But whosoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has been made clear to him and follows a path other than that of the believers, We shall let him follow what he has turned to and We shall roast him in Gehenna (Hell) an evil arrival.","609":"Allah does not forgive (the sin of inventing an) association with Him, but He forgives other sins to whomsoever He will. Whosoever associates with Allah has gone astray in far error.","610":"Instead of Him they supplicate to none but females, and indeed they supplicate to none except the rebellious satan,","611":"whom Allah has cursed and he (satan) said: 'Indeed, I will take to myself an appointed portion of Your worshipers,","612":"and lead them astray. I shall fill them with fancies and order them to cut off the ears of cattle. I shall order them to alter the creation of Allah' Indeed, whosoever chooses satan for a guide, instead of Allah, has surely suffered a clear loss.","613":"he promises them and fills them with fancies, but what satan promises them is only a delusion.","614":"Those, their shelter will be Gehenna (Hell), and from it they shall find no refuge.","615":"But those who believe and do good works We shall admit them to Gardens underneath which rivers flow, and there they shall live for ever, the promise of Allah is true. And who is truer in speech than Allah!","616":"It is not by your fancies, nor by the fancies of the People of the Book. Whosoever does evil shall be recompensed for it, and he will not find for himself, other than Allah, a guardian or helper.","617":"But whosoever does good works of righteousness, whether they be a believing male or female, shall enter Paradise, and not be wronged a pit mark of a date stone.","618":"And who is better in religion than he who submits his face to Allah, being a gooddoer, and follows the Creed of Abraham, pure in faith? Allah took Abraham for a close friend.","619":"To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. Allah encompasses everything.","620":"They will ask you for a verdict concerning women. Say: \"Allah decides for you concerning them, and what has been recited in the Book concerning orphaned women to whom you do not give what is written, and yet desire to marry them, and the abased children, and that you secure justice for orphans. Whatever good you do, Allah has knowledge it.","621":"If a woman fears hatred or aversion from her husband there is no fault in them if the couple set things right between them, for reconciliation is better. Avarice attends the souls, but if you do what is good and are cautious, surely, Allah is Aware of what you do.","622":"You will not be able to be just between your women, even though you are eager. Do not be altogether partial so that you leave her as if she were suspended. If you reform and are cautious, Allah is the Forgiver, the Merciful.","623":"But if they separate, Allah will enrich each of them out from His Vastness. He is the Embracer, the Wise.","624":"To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and earth. We have charged those who were given the Book before you and you to fear Allah. If you disbelieve, to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. Allah is Rich, the Praised.","625":"To Allah belongs all that is in heaven and earth. It is sufficient that Allah is a Guardian.","626":"O people, if He will, He could make you extinct, and bring others. Surely, Allah is Powerful over that.","627":"Whosoever desires the reward of the world, with Allah is the reward of the world and of the Everlasting Life. Allah is the Hearer, the Seer.","628":"Believers, be maintainers of justice and witnesses for Allah, even though it is against yourselves, your parents, or your kinsmen, whether he is rich or poor, Allah has more rights over both of them. So do not follow desires, so that you are (not) just. If you twist or turn, Allah is Aware of what you do.","629":"Believers, believe in Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad), in the Book He has sent down to His Messenger, and in the Book He sent down before. Whosoever disbelieves in Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Last Day, has surely gone astray into far error.","630":"Those who believe, and then disbelieve, and then believe, and then disbelieve, and increase in disbelief Allah is not to forgive them nor guide them on a way.","631":"Give glad tidings to the hypocrites that for them there is a painful punishment.","632":"Those who take unbelievers for guides instead of believers, are they seeking might with them? Surely, the Might altogether belongs to Allah.","633":"He has sent down upon you in the Book: \"When you hear His verses being disbelieved or mocked, do not sit with them until they engage in other talk, or elseyou will surely be like them.

If a victory comes to you from Allah they say: 'Were we not with you' But if the unbelievers get a portion, they say, 'Were we not mightier than you, and did we not defend you from the believers' Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection. Allah will not grant the unbelievers any way over the believers.","635":"The hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but Allah is deceiving them. When they stand up to pray, they stand up lazily, showing off to the people and do not remember Allah, except a little,","636":"wavering between (belief and disbelief), neither to these nor to those, and whom Allah leads astray, you will not find a way for him.","637":"Believers, do not take the unbelievers for guides instead of the believers, or do you desire to give Allah a clear authority over you?","638":"The hypocrites will be in the lowest place of the Fire, you will not find a helper for them.","639":"But those who repent and mend (their ways), who hold fast to Allah, and make their religion sincerely for Allah they are with the believers, and Allah will certainly give the believers a great wage.","640":"What, would Allah do with punishing you if you thank and believe! Allah is the Thanker, the Knower.","641":"Allah does not love the shouting of evil words, except by he who has been wronged. He is the Hearer, the Knower.","642":"If you display good or hide it, or pardon an evil, surely, Allah is the Pardoner, the Powerful.","643":"Those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messengers, and desire to divide between Allah and His Messengers (by believing in Him without them), and say, 'We believe in some (Prophets Moses and Jesus), and disbelieve in some of them (such as Prophet Muhammad)' desiring to take between this (and that) a way (between belief and disbelief)","644":"those in truth are the unbelievers, and We have prepared for the unbelievers a humiliating punishment.","645":"And those who believe in Allah, and His Messengers and do not divide between any of them; to those, We shall surely give them their wages. Allah is the Forgiver, the Most Merciful.","646":"The People of the Book ask you to bring down upon them a Book from heaven. Of Moses they asked greater than that, they said to him: 'Show us Allah openly' And a thunderbolt took them for their evil doing. Then they took to themselves the calf, after the clear proofs had come to them, yet We forgave that and We gave Moses clear authority.","647":"And We raised the Mount above them, and took covenant with them, and We said: 'Enter in at the gate, prostrating', and We said to them, 'Do not transgress the Sabbath', and We took from them a solemn covenant.","648":"So, for their breaking of the covenant, and disbelieving the verses of Allah, and killing their Prophets without right and for saying, 'Our hearts are covered' no, but Allah has sealed them for their disbelief, so, except for a few, they do not believe.","649":"Also for their disbelief and their saying about Mary a great calumny,","650":"and for their saying, 'We killed the Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary, the Messenger (and Prophet) of Allah' They did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, but to them, he (the crucified) had been given the look (of Prophet Jesus). Those who differ concerning him (Prophet Jesus) are surely in doubt regarding him, they have no knowledge of him, except the following of supposition, and (it is) a certainty they did not kill him.","651":"Rather, Allah raised him up to Him. Allah is Almighty, the Wise.","652":"There is not one of the People of the Book but will surely believe in him (Prophet Jesus) before his death, and on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them.","653":"And for the harmdoing of those of Jewry, We have forbidden them the good things that were permitted to them, and also for their barring many from the way of Allah.","654":"And for their taking of usury, that they were prohibited, and consuming the wealth of people in falsehood, for the unbelievers among them We have prepared a painful punishment.","655":"But those of them that are firmly rooted in knowledge, and the believers believing in what has been sent down to you (Prophet Muhammad), and what was sent down before you, and those who establish the prayer and pay the obligatory charity, and those who believe in Allah and the Last Day to those, We surely give a great wage.","656":"We have revealed to you as We revealed to Noah and to the Prophets after him, and We revealed to (Prophets) Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the tribes, Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and We gave to David the Psalms.","657":"And Messengers of whom We have narrated to you before, and Messengers of whom We did not narrate to you. Certainly, Allah talked to Moses.","658":"Messengers bearing glad tidings and warning, so that the people will have no argument against Allah, after the Messengers. Allah is the Almighty, the Wise.","659":"But Allah bears witness for that which He has sent down to you. He has sent it down with His Knowledge, and the angels bear witness, it is sufficient that Allah is the Witness.","660":"Those who disbelieve and bar from the way of Allah have strayed into far error.","661":"Surely, those who disbelieve and have done harm. Allah would not forgive them, neither guide them to a Path,","662":"except the road to Gehenna, there they are eternal, and for Allah that is an easy matter.","663":"O people, the Messenger (Prophet Muhammad) has come to you with the truth from your Lord, so believe, it is better for you. If you disbelieve, to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. And Allah is the Knower, the Wise.","664":"People of the Book, do not exaggerate your religion. Do not say about Allah except the truth. Indeed, the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, is only a Messenger (and Prophet) of Allah, and His Word (Be) which He gave to Mary, and a (created) spirit by Him. So believe in Allah and His Messengers and do not say: 'Trinity. 'Refrain, it is better for you. Allah is only One God. Exaltations to Him that He should have son! To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth, it is sufficient that Allah is the Guardian.","665":"The Messiah would not despise being a worshiper of Allah, nor would the angels who are near. Whosoever despises worshipping Him, and becomes proud, He will surely assemble them all to Him.","666":"As for those who believe and did good deeds, He will pay them in full their wages, and He will increase them from His Bounty. As for those who despise and became proud, He will punish them with a painful punishment, and they will find neither a guide nor a helper for themselves, other than Allah.","667":"O people, a proof has come to you from your Lord, and We have sent down to you a clear light.","668":"Those who believe in Allah and hold fast to Him, He will surely admit them to a Mercy and Bounty from Him, and He will guide them to Him on a Straight Path.","669":"They will ask you for a verdict. Say: 'Allah rules for you concerning the indirect heir (alkalalah which is), if a person dies, having no children, but he has a sister, she shall receive half of what he leaves, and he is her heir if she has no children. If there are two sisters, they shall receive twothirds of what he leaves, if there are siblings, men and women, for a male like the share of two females. Allah clarifies to you, lest you go astray, Allah is Knowledgeable of everything.","670":"Believers, fulfill your obligations. It is lawful for you (to eat the flesh of) the beast among cattle other than that which is recited to you, hunting is forbidden while you are on pilgrimage. Allah decrees what He will.","671":"Believers, do not violate the rites of Allah, or the sacred month, or the offerings, or (those hung with) necklaces, nor those whose aim is to the Sacred House seeking from their Lord bounty and pleasure. Once your pilgrimage has ended, you are free to hunt. Do not allow your hatred for a nation who would bar you from the Holy Mosque to lead you to transgress. And cooperate in righteousness and warding off (evil), and do not cooperate in sinfulness and transgression. Have fear of Allah, for Allah is Stern in retribution.","672":"You are forbidden (to consume) the dead, blood and the flesh of swine; also flesh dedicated to any other than Allah, the flesh of strangled (animals) and of those beaten, that which is killed by falling, gored to death, mangled by beasts of prey, unless you find it (still alive) and slaughter it; also of animals sacrificed on stones (to idols). (You are forbidden) to seek division by the arrows, that is debauchery. Those who disbelieve have this day despaired of your religion. Do not fear them, but fear Me. This day I have perfected your religion for you and completed My favor to you. I have approved Islam to be your religion. (As for) he who does not intend to commit a sin but is constrained by hunger to eat of what is forbidden, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.","673":"They ask you what is lawful to them. Say: 'The good things are lawful to you, as well as that which you have taught the birds and beasts of prey to catch, teaching them of what Allah has taught you. Eat of what they catch for you, pronouncing upon it the Name of Allah. And fear Allah, Allah is Swift at reckoning'","674":"The good things have this day been made lawful to you. The food of those to whom the Book was given is lawful to you, and your food is lawful to them. Lawful to you (in marriage) are the free believing women and the free women from among those who were given the Book before you, provided that you give them their dowries in marriage, neither committing fornication nor taking them as mistresses. Whosoever denies the belief, his labors will be annulled. In the Everlasting Life he is of the losers.","675":"Believers, when you rise to pray wash your faces and your hands as far as the elbow, and wipe your heads and (wash) your feet to the ankle. If you are in a state of impurity, cleanse yourselves. But if you are sick or traveling, or, if when you have just relieved yourselves or had intercourse with women and you cannot find water, touch the clean surface of the earth and rub your hands and faces with it. Allah does not wish to burden you, He seeks only to purify you and to complete His Favor to you in order that you may thank.","676":"Remember the favor of Allah upon you, and the covenant with which He bound you when you said: 'We hear and obey' Have fear of Allah. Allah is the Knower of the innermost of the chests'","677":"Believers, be dutiful to Allah and bearers of just witness. Do not allow your hatred for other people to turn you away from justice. Deal justly; it is nearer to piety. Have fear of Allah; Allah is Aware of what you do.","678":"Allah has promised those who believe and do good works forgiveness and a great reward.","679":"As for those who disbelieve and belie Our verses, they shall become the companions of Hell.","680":"Believers, remember the favor which Allah bestowed upon you when certain people were about to stretch their hands towards you, but He restrained them. Have fear of Allah. In Allah let the believers put their trust.","681":"Allah made a covenant with the Children of Israel and raised among them twelve chieftains. He said: 'I shall be with you and if you establish the prayers and pay the obligatory charity; if you believe in My Messengers and assist them and give Allah a generous loan, I shall forgive you your sins and admit you to Gardens underneath which rivers flow. Whosoever amongst you disbelieves after that, he indeed has strayed from the Straight Path'","682":"But because they broke their covenant, We cursed them and hardened their hearts. They changed the Words from their places and have forgotten a portion of what they were reminded. Except for a few, you will always find treachery from them, yet pardon them, and forgive; indeed Allah loves the gooddoers.","683":"With those who said they were Nazarenes, We made a Covenant, but they have forgotten much of what they were reminded. Therefore, We stirred among them enmity and hatred till the Day of Resurrection when Allah will inform them of all that they have done.","684":"People of the Book! Our Messenger (Muhammad) has come to clarify to you much of what you have hidden of the Book, and to forgive you much. A light has come to you from Allah and a Clear Book,","685":"with which Allah guides those who seek His pleasure to the Paths of Peace. By His permission He takes them out from darkness to the light, and guides them to a Straight Path.","686":"Those who say that Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary are indeed those who disbelieved. Say: 'Who then could prevent any thing from Allah, if He willed to destroy the Messiah, son of Mary, together with his mother and all the people of the earth? For Allah is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them. He creates what He will and has power over all things'","687":"The Jews and the Nazarenes say: 'We are the children of Allah and His loved ones' Say: 'Why then does He punish you for your sins? Surely, you are mortals amongst what He created. He forgives whom He will, and punishes whom He will. For Allah is the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them. All shall return to Him'","688":"People of the Book! After an interval during which there were no Messengers, Our Messenger (Muhammad) has come to clarify (your religion) to you, lest you should say: 'No bearer of glad tidings or a warner has come to us' Indeed, there has come to you a bearer of glad tidings and a warner. Allah has power over all things.","689":"(Remember) when Moses said to his people. 'Remember, my people, the favors which Allah has bestowed upon you. He has raised up Prophets among you, made you kings, and given you that which He has not given to any one of the worlds.","690":"Enter, my people, the Holy Land which Allah has written for you. Do not turn back in your footsteps, lest you shall turn to be losers'","691":"'Moses' they replied, 'therein is a nation of giants. We will not enter until they depart from it; if they depart from it only then shall we enter'","692":"Thereupon, two pious men whom Allah had favored said: 'Go in to them through the gate, and if you enter you shall surely be victorious. In Allah put your trust, if you are believers'","693":"They said: 'Moses, we will never go in so long as they are in it. Go, you and your Lord, to fight. We will stay here'","694":"He said: 'Lord, I have none but myself and my brother. Set a barrier between us and the wicked people'","695":"He said: 'They shall be forbidden this land for forty years, during which time they shall wander (homeless) on the earth. Do not grieve for these wicked people.'","696":"Recite to them in all truth the news of Adam's two sons; how they each made an offering, and how the offering of the one was accepted while that of the other was not. He said: 'I will surely kill you' (The other) said: 'Allah accepts only from the righteous.","697":"If you stretch your hand to kill me, I shall not stretch mine to kill you; for I fear Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.","698":"I would rather you bear my sin and your sin and become among the inhabitants of Hell. Such is the recompense of the harmdoers'","699":"His soul made it seem fair to him to slay his brother; he killed him and became one of the lost.","700":"Then Allah sent down a crow, which dug the earth to show him how to bury the naked corpse of his brother. 'Alas' he said, 'am I unable to be like this crow and so I bury my brother's naked corpse' And he became among those who regret.","701":"That was why We wrote for the Children of Israel that who ever killed a soul, except for a soul slain, or for sedition in the earth, it should be considered as though he had killed all mankind; and that who ever saved it should be regarded as though he had saved all mankind. Our Messengers brought them proofs; then many of them thereafter commit excesses in the earth.","702":"The recompense of those who make war against Allah and His Messenger and spread corruption in the land is that they are to be killed or crucified, or have their hand and a foot cut off on opposite sides, or be expelled from the land. For them is shame in this world and a great punishment in the Everlasting Life;","703":"except those who repent before you have power over them. For you must know that Allah is Forgiving, the Most Merciful.","704":"Believers, have fear of Allah and seek the means by which you come to Him. Struggle in His Way in order that you are prosperous.","705":"As for those who disbelieve, if they possessed all that the earth contains and as much besides to ransom themselves from the punishment of the Day of Resurrection, it shall not be accepted from them. Theirs shall be a painful punishment.","706":"They will wish to get out of the Fire, but they shall not, theirs shall be a lasting punishment.","707":"As for the man or woman who is guilty of theft, recompense them by cutting off their hands for their crimes. That is the punishment from Allah. Allah is Mighty, Wise.","708":"But whoever repents and mends his ways after committing evil shall be pardoned by Allah. Allah is Forgiving, Most Merciful.","709":"Do you not know that to Allah belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth? He punishes whom He will and forgives whom He will. Allah has power over all things.","710":"O Messenger, do not grieve for those who race into disbelief; those who say with their mouth: 'We believe' yet their hearts did not believe, and the Jews who listen to lies and listen to other nations who have not come to you. They pervert the words in their places and say: 'If you are given this, accept it; if not, then beware' Whomsoever Allah wishes to try, you will not own anything with Allah concerning him. For those whose hearts Allah does not will to purify shall be disgrace in this world and a grievous punishment in the Everlasting Life.","711":"They are listeners to lies and devourers of the unlawful. If they come to you, judge between them or turn away from them. If you avoid them they cannot harm you in anything; but if you judge, judge between them with fairness. Allah loves the just.","712":"But how will they come to you for judgment when they already have the Torah in which is the judgement of Allah? Then they turn away after that; those are not believers.","713":"We have sent down the Torah in which there is guidance and light by which the submissive prophets judged the Jews, as did the rabbis and those of their Lord, guarding what they were required to of the Book of Allah, and for which they were witness. Do not fear people, but fear Me. And, do not take a small price for My verses. Those who do not judge with what Allah has sent down are the unbelievers.","714":"We have written for them a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and for wounds equal retaliation, but whosoever forgoes it as a freewill offering, it will be an expiation for him. Whoever does not judge according to what Allah has sent down are the harmdoers.","715":"And We sent, following in their footsteps (Prophet) Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which was before him in the Torah, and gave him the Gospel, in which there is guidance and light, confirming that which was before him in the Torah, a guide and an admonition to the cautious.","716":"Therefore, let the people of Gospel judge in accordance with that which Allah has sent in it. Those who do not judge according to that which Allah has sent down are the evildoers.","717":"And to you We have revealed the Book with the truth confirming the Book that was revealed before it, and a guardian over it. Therefore, give judgment among them in accordance to what Allah has sent down and do not yield to their fancies from the truth that has come to you. We have ordained a law and a Path for each of you. Had Allah willed, He could have made you one nation but that He might try you by that which He has bestowed upon you. Race with one another in good works, to Allah you shall all return and He will declare to you what you were at variance.","718":"And judge among them in accordance to that which Allah has sent down and do not be led by their desires. Take heed lest they should turn you away from a part of that which Allah has sent to you. If they reject your judgment, know that Allah wants to scourge them for some of their sins. Many of the people are wrongdoers.","719":"Is it pagan laws that they wish to be judged by? Who is a better judge than Allah for a nation whose belief is firm?","720":"Believers, take neither Jews nor Nazarenes for your guides. They are guides of one another. Whosoever of you takes them for a guide shall become one of their number. Allah does not guide the wrongdoers.","721":"You see those in whose hearts is sickness racing with one another to come to them. They say: 'We fear lest a change of fortune should befall us' May Allah bring victory or make known His ordinance, then, they shall regret what they had hidden in themselves.","722":"Then the believers will say: 'Are those (the ones) who solemnly swore by Allah that they would stand by you' Their works will be annulled and they shall be the losers.","723":"Believers, whosoever of you turns from his religion, Allah will bring a nation whom He loves and they love Him, humble towards the believers and stern towards the unbelievers, striving for the Path of Allah and fearless of anyone's blame. Such is the Bounty of Allah; He bestows it on whom He will. He is the Embracer, the Knower.","724":"Your guide is only Allah, His Messenger, and the believers; those who establish the prayer, pay their obligatory charity, and bow down (in worship).","725":"Whosoever takes Allah for a guide, His Messenger, and the believers the party of Allah is the victor.","726":"Believers, do not take as guides those who were given the Book before you who have made of your religion a jest and a pastime, nor the unbelievers. Have fear of Allah, if you are believers.","727":"When you call to prayer, they treat it as a jest and a pastime. That is because they are a people who have no understanding.","728":"Say: 'People of the Book, do you blame us for any reason other than that we believe in Allah and in what has been sent down to us, and what was sent down before us, and that most of you are evildoers'","729":"Say: 'Shall I tell you who will receive a worse recompense from Allah than that? Those whom Allah has cursed and with whom He is angry, and made some of them apes and swine, and those who worship the devil. The place of these is worse, and they have strayed further from the Right Path'","730":"When they came to you they said: 'We are believers' Indeed, they have entered with disbelief, and so they have departed with it; Allah knows best what they conceal.","731":"You see many of them race with one another in sin and transgression and devour the unlawful. Evil is what they do.","732":"Do those of the Lord and the rabbis not forbid them to speak sinfully and to devour what is unlawful? Evil indeed is what they were doing.","733":"The Jews say: 'The Hand of Allah is chained' Their own hands are chained! And they are cursed for what they said! Rather, His Hands are both outstretched, He spends as He will. That which Allah has sent down to you will surely increase the tyranny and disbelief of many of them. We have stirred among them enmity and hatred up until the Day of Resurrection. Whenever they kindle the fire of war, Allah extinguishes it. They spread corruption in the land, and Allah does not love those who corrupt.","734":"If the People of the Book had believed and kept from evil, We would pardon them their sins and admit them to the Gardens of Delight.","735":"If they had established the Torah and the Gospel and what was sent down to them from their Lord they would be eating from above them and from beneath their feet. Some of them are a righteous nation; but many of them evil is what they do.","736":"O Messenger, deliver what is sent down to you from your Lord; if you do not, you will not have conveyed His Message. Allah protects you from the people. Allah does not guide the nation, the unbelievers.","737":"Say: 'People of the Book, you are not upon anything until you establish the Torah and the Gospel and that which is sent down to you from your Lord' And that which is sent down to you (Prophet Muhammad) from your Lord will surely increase the tyranny and disbelief of many of them. But do not grieve for the unbelieving nation.","738":"Those who believe, Jews, Sabaeans, and Nazarenes whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good shall neither fear, nor shall they sorrow (as long as they do not reject any of the prophets).","739":"We took a covenant with the Children of Israel and sent forth Messengers to them. But whenever a Messenger came to them with that which did not suit their fancies they belied some and killed others.","740":"They thought there would be no trial; so they were blind and deaf. Then Allah turned towards them; then again many of them were blind and deaf. And Allah is the Seer of what they do.","741":"The unbelievers are those who say: 'Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary' But the Messiah said: 'Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. 'He who associates anything with Allah, Allah has indeed forbidden Paradise to him, and his abode shall be in the Fire. The harmdoers shall have no helpers.","742":"Indeed those who say: 'Allah is the third of the Trinity' became unbelievers. There is but One God. If they do not desist in what they say, a painful punishment will afflict those of them that disbelieve.","743":"Will they not turn to Allah in repentance and ask His forgiveness? He is Forgiving, Merciful.","744":"The Messiah, the son of Mary, was not except a Messenger, other Messengers had gone before him. His mother was in the state of sincerity, they both ate food. See how We make plain to them Our signs. Then, see how perverted they are.","745":"Say: 'Will you worship instead of Allah that which owns neither harm, nor benefit for you? Allah is the Hearer, Knower'","746":"Say: 'People of the Book! Do not exaggerate your religion, other than the truth, and do not follow the desires of a people who went astray before, and led many astray, and, (once again) have gone astray from the Straight Path'","747":"Those who disbelieved of the Children of Israel were cursed by the tongue of (Prophets) David and Jesus, the son of Mary, because they disobeyed and transgressed.","748":"They did not forbid one another from the wrongdoing they were committing. Evil is what they were doing.","749":"You see many of them taking the unbelievers as guides. Evil is that to which their souls forwarded them, that Allah is angered against them, and in the punishment they shall live for ever.","750":"Had they believed in Allah and the Prophet (Muhammad) and that which is sent down to him, they would not have taken them as guides. But many of them are evildoers.","751":"You will find that the most people in enmity to the believers are the Jews and idolaters, and that the nearest in affection to the believers are those who say: 'We are Nazarenes' That is because amongst them there are priests and monks; and because they are not proud.","752":"When they listen to that which was sent down to the Messenger, you will see their eyes fill with tears as they recognize its truth. They say: 'Lord, we believe. Write us among the witnesses.","753":"Why should we not believe in Allah and in the truth that has come down to us? Why should we not hope for admission among the righteous'","754":"For their words Allah has rewarded them with Gardens underneath which rivers flow, where they shall live for ever. Such is the recompense of the righteous.","755":"But those who disbelieve and belie Our verses shall be the companions of Hell.","756":"Believers, do not forbid the good things that Allah has made lawful to you. Do not transgress; Allah does not love the transgressors.","757":"Eat of the lawful and good things with which Allah has provided you. Have fear of Allah in whom you believe.","758":"Allah will not take you to account for a slip in your oaths. But He will take you to account for the oaths which you solemnly swear. Its expiation is the feeding of ten needy (people) with such food as you normally offer to your own people; or the clothing of them; or the freeing of a slave. He who does not have must fast three days. That is the expiation of your oaths when you have sworn; but keep your oaths. Allah makes plain to you His verses, in order that you are thankful.","759":"Believers, wine and gambling, idols and divining arrows are abominations from the work of satan. Avoid them, in order that you prosper.","760":"satan seeks to stir up enmity and hatred among you by means of wine and gambling, and to bar you from the remembrance of Allah and from praying. Will you not abstain from them?","761":"Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger. Beware; if you give no heed, know that Our Messenger's duty is only to give the clear delivery.","762":"No blame shall be attached to those who believe and did good works in regard to any food they have eaten, so long as they ward off (the forbidden) and believe, and do good deeds, then they fear and believe, and again, so long as they fear and do fine deeds. Allah loves the generous.","763":"Believers, Allah will test you by means of some hunting which you can catch with your hands and with your spears, in order that Allah knows those who fear Him in private. For he who transgresses thereafter shall be a painful punishment.","764":"O believers, do not kill the hunted while you are in pilgrim sanctity. Whosoever of you kills it willfully there shall be a recompense, the like of what he has slain from cattle as shall be judged by two just men among you, an offering to reach the Ka'bah; or expiation food for needy persons or the equivalent of that in fasting, so that he may taste the weight of the recompense of his action. Allah has pardoned what is past; but whoever offends again, Allah will take vengeance on him. Allah is the Almighty, Owner of Vengeance.","765":"Made lawful to you is the fished of the sea and its food, an enjoyment for you and for travelers. But you are forbidden the hunted of the land whilst you are on pilgrimage. Have fear of Allah, before whom you shall all be assembled.","766":"Allah has made the Ka'bah the Sacred House, as an establishment for people; and the Sacred Month, and the offering, and the necklaces, in order that you know that Allah has knowledge of all that is in the heavens and the earth; and that Allah has knowledge of all things.","767":"Know that Allah is Stern in retribution, and that Allah is the Forgiver and the Most Merciful.","768":"The duty of the Messenger is only the delivery (of the Message). Allah knows what you reveal and what you hide.","769":"Say: 'The evil and the good are not alike, even if the abundance of evil pleases you. Have fear of Allah, you who are possessed of minds, in order that you prosper'","770":"Believers, do not ask about things that if they appeared to you, would only upset you; but if you ask about them when the Koran is being sent down, they shall be made plain to you. Allah will pardon it; Allah is Forgiving, Clement.","771":"A nation asked about them before you, and with it they became unbelievers.","772":"Allah has not made cattle, a slit eared shecamel, nor a freely grazing shecamel, nor a shecamel that bore twins, nor an uncastrated camel (dedicated to idols), but those who disbelieve invent lies against Allah. Most of them do not understand.","773":"When it is said to them: 'Come to that which Allah has sent down, and to the Messenger' they reply: 'Sufficient for us is what we have found our fathers upon' even though their fathers knew nothing and were not guided.","774":"Believers, look after your own souls, he who goes astray cannot harm you if you are guided. You shall all return to Allah, and He will inform you of what you have done.","775":"Believers, if you are traveling in the land and the affliction of death befalls you, at the bequeathing testimony shall be two just men from among you, or two others from other than you. You shall detain both after the prayer, and they shall swear by Allah if you are doubtful: 'We will not sell it for a price, even though it were a near kinsmen, nor will we hide the testimony of Allah, because then we would surely be among the sinful'","776":"But if it is discovered that both of them have been subject to sinning, then two others shall stand in their place, these being the nearest of those most concerned, and they shall swear by Allah: 'Our testimony is truer than their testimony, and we have not transgressed, because then we would surely be among the harmdoers'","777":"So it is likelier that they will bear testimony in proper form, or else they will be afraid that oaths may be rejected after their oaths. Fear Allah, and listen; Allah does not guide the people of the evildoers.","778":"On a Day, Allah will gather all the Messengers and ask them: 'How were you answered' They will reply: 'We have no knowledge, You are the Knower of the unseen'","779":"When Allah said: '(Prophet) Jesus, son of Mary, remember the favor upon you and on your mother; how I strengthened you with the Holy Spirit (Gabriel), to speak to people in your cradle and of age (when he descends and dies); how I taught you the Book and Wisdom, the Torah and the Gospel; and how, by My permission, you fashioned from clay the likeness of a bird, and breathed into it so that, by My permission, it became a living bird. How, by My permission, you healed the blind man and the leper, and by My permission you brought the dead forth; and how I protected you from the Children of Israel when you brought them clear signs; whereupon the unbelievers among them said: \"This is nothing but plain magic\".","780":"When I revealed to the disciples to believe in Me and in My Messenger they replied: \"We believe, bear witness that we submit.\"","781":"When the disciples said: 'O (Prophet) Jesus, son of Mary, can your Lord send down to us a table from heaven' He replied: 'Have fear of Allah, if you are believers'","782":"'We wish to eat of it' they said, 'so that we can satisfy our hearts and know that what you said to us is true, and that we become witnesses to it'","783":"'Allah, our Lord' said (Prophet) Jesus, the son of Mary, 'send down upon us a table out of heaven, that shall be a festival for us the first and the last of us and a sign from You. And provide for us; You are the Best of providers'","784":"Allah replied: 'I am sending it to you. But whoever of you disbelieves thereafter I shall punish him with a punishment that I do not punish anyone from the worlds'","785":"And when Allah said: '(Prophet) Jesus, son of Mary, did you ever say to the people: \"Take me and my mother for two gods, other than Allah?\" 'Exaltations to You' he said, 'how could I say that to which I have no right? If I had said that, You would have surely known. You know what is in my self, but I do not know what is in Yours. Indeed, You are the Knowledgeable of the unseen.","786":"I spoke to them of nothing except that which You ordered me, that you worship Allah, my Lord and our Lord. I witnessed them whilst living in their midst and ever since You took me to You, You have been the Watcher over them. You are the Witness of everything.","787":"If You punish them (for their disbelief), they surely are Your subjects; and if You forgive them, surely You are the Almighty, the Wise'","788":"Allah will say: 'This is the Day the truthful shall benefit by their truthfulness. They shall live for ever in Gardens underneath which rivers flow. Allah is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him. That is the great winning'","789":"To Allah belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is in them. He has power over all things.","790":"Praise is due to Allah, who has created the heavens and the earth and made darkness and light. Yet the unbelievers make (others) equal with their Lord.","791":"It is He who has created you from clay. He has decreed a term for you and another one set with Him. Yet you are still in doubt.","792":"He is Allah in the heavens and earth. He has knowledge of all that you hide and all that you reveal. He knows what you earn.","793":"Yet every time a sign comes to them from the signs of their Lord, they turn away from it.","794":"They belied the truth when it came to them, but there shall come to them news of that they were mocking.","795":"Have they not seen how many generations We have destroyed before them whom We had established in the land in a way We never established you, sending down for them abundant water from the sky and made the rivers to flow underneath them? Yet because they sinned, We destroyed them and raised up other generations after them.","796":"Had We sent down to you a Book on parchment and they touched it with their own hands, those who disbelieved would say: 'This is nothing but plain magic'","797":"They ask: 'Why has no angel been sent down to him' If We had sent down an angel, their fate would have been determined and they would never have been respited.","798":"If We had made him an angel, We would have given him the resemblance of a man, and would have as such confused them with that in which they are already confused.","799":"Other Messengers have been mocked before you.

He is the Wise, the Aware.","808":"Say: 'What thing is greatest in testimony' Say: 'Allah is a witness between me and you. This Koran has been revealed to me in order that I can warn you and all whom it reaches.

The harmdoers shall never prosper.","811":"On the Day when We gather them all together We shall say to the idolaters: 'Where are your partners now, those whom you claimed'","812":"Then it was not their trial, but they will say: 'By Allah, our Lord we have never been idolaters'","813":"Look how they lie against themselves, and how that which they were forging has gone astray from them!","814":"Some of them listen to you. But We have cast veils over their hearts lest they understand it and in their ears heaviness; and if they see every sign they do not believe in it.

They destroy none except themselves, though they do not sense it.","816":"If you could see them when they are set before the Fire! They will say: 'Would that we could return! Then we would not belie the verses of our Lord and would be believers'","817":"Indeed, that which they concealed will appear to them.

They are indeed liars.","818":"They say: 'There is only but our present life; we shall not be resurrected'","819":"If you could see them when they are made to stand before their Lord! He will say: 'Is this not the truth' 'Yes, by our Lord' they will reply, and He will say: 'Taste then the punishment, for that which you disbelieved'","820":"They are lost indeed, those who belied the meeting with Allah. When the Hour overtakes them suddenly, they will say: 'Alas, for us, that we neglected it' On their backs they shall be bearing their sinful loads; how evil is what they sin!","821":"The life of this world is but playing and an amusement. Surely, the Everlasting home is better for the cautious. Will you not understand?","822":"We know what they say saddens you. It is not you that they belie; but the harmdoers deny the verses of Allah.","823":"Messengers indeed were belied before you, yet they became patient with that which they were belied, and were hurt until Our help came to them. There is none to alter the Words of Allah; and there has already come to you some news of the Messengers.","824":"If their turning away is hard upon you, seek if you can, a tunnel in the ground or a ladder to the sky by which you can bring them a sign. Had Allah willed, He would gather them to guidance. Do not then be among the ignorant.","825":"Those who listen will surely answer. As for the dead, Allah will revive them. To Him they shall return.","826":"They ask: 'Why has no sign been sent down to him from his Lord' Say: 'Allah is Able to send down a sign' But most of them do not know.","827":"There is no crawling creature on the earth, nor a bird that flies with its two wings, but they are nations like you. We have neglected nothing in the Book. They shall all be gathered before their Lord.","828":"Those who belie Our verses are deaf and dumb, in darkness. Allah leaves in error whom He will, and guides to the Straight Path whom He pleases.","829":"Say: 'Do you see yourselves when the punishment of Allah smites you or the Hour overtakes you, will you call on any except Allah, if you are truthful?","830":"No, on Him alone you will call, and He will remove that for which you call upon Him, if He will. Then you will forget what you associate (with Him).","831":"Before you We sent forth to other nations, and then seized them with misery and hardship so that they might humble themselves.","832":"If only they humbled themselves when Our scourge overtook them! But their hearts were hardened, and satan decorated to them what they were doing.","833":"And when they had forgotten that with which they have been admonished, We opened the gates of everything to them, until just as they were rejoicing in what they were given, We suddenly seized them and they were in utter despair.","834":"As such the harmdoers were annihilated. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds!","835":"Say: 'What would you see if Allah took away your hearing and your sight, and set a seal upon your hearts, who is a god, other than Allah, to bring it back to you' Look how We make plain to them Our verses, and yet they turn away.","836":"Say: 'What do you see yourselves then, if the punishment of Allah overtook you suddenly or openly, would any perish but the harmdoing nation'","837":"We send forth Our Messengers only to give glad tidings to mankind and to warn them. Those who believe and mend their ways shall have nothing to fear or to be saddened.","838":"But those who belie Our verses, punishment shall touch them for their misdeeds.","839":"Say: 'I do not tell you that I have the treasuries of Allah or know the unseen, nor do I claim to be an angel. I follow only that which is revealed to me' Say: 'Are the blind and the seeing alike? Will you not think'","840":"And warn with it those who fear to be brought before their Lord that they have no guardian or intercessor, other than Allah, in order that they are cautious.","841":"Do not drive away those who call on their Lord morning and evening, seeking only His Face. Nothing of their account falls upon you, and nothing of your account falls upon them, that you should drive them away and so become one of the harmdoers.","842":"As such We have made some of them a means for testing others, so that they should say: 'Are those whom Allah favors amongst us' But does not Allah best know the thankful?","843":"When those who believe in Our verses come to you, say: 'Peace be upon you. Your Lord has decreed Mercy on Himself, if any one of you commits evil through ignorance, and then repents, and mends his ways, then He is Forgiving, the Most Merciful'","844":"As such We make plain Our verses, so that the path of the wicked will be clear.","845":"Say: 'I am forbidden to worship whom you call upon instead of Allah' Say: 'I will not yield to your wishes, for then I should have strayed and should not be of those guided'","846":"Say: 'I am upon a clear proof from my Lord, yet you belie Him. I do not have that which you seek to hasten; judgement is for Allah alone. He narrates the truth and He is the Best of deciders'","847":"Say: 'If what you seek to hasten were with me, the matter between you and me would be decided, and Allah knows very well the harmdoers'","848":"With Him are the keys of the unseen, none knows them but He. He knows that which is in the land and sea. No leaf falls except He knows it, and there is no grain in the darkness of the earth, fresh or withered, but is recorded in a clear Book.","849":"It is He who makes you to die by night, knowing what you have gained by day, and then resurrects you so that an ordained term is realized. To Him you shall return, and He will tell you of what you have been doing.","850":"He is the Conqueror over His worshipers. He sends forth guardians who watch over you until death comes to one of you, when Our messengers take him, and they are not neglectful.","851":"Then, they are returned to Allah their Guardian, the True. Surely, the judgement is for Him, He is the Swiftest of reckoners'","852":"Say: 'Who saves you from the darkness of the land and sea, when you call out to Him humbly and in secret, (saying:) \"If You save us from this, we will be among the thankful.\"","853":"Say: 'Allah saves you from them, and from all afflictions. Then, you associate (with Him)'","854":"Say: 'He is Able to send forth upon you punishment from above you or beneath your feet, or to divide you into discordant factions, and to make some of you taste the affliction of the other' Look how We make plain Our verses, in order that they understand.","855":"Your nation has belied it (the Koran), although it is the truth. Say: 'I am not a guardian over you.","856":"Every news has its appointed time; you will surely know'","857":"When you see those who plunge (scoffing) into Our verses, withdraw from them till they plunge into some other talk. If satan causes you to forget, leave the wrongdoing people as soon as you remember.","858":"Those who are cautious are not accountable for them in anything, but it is a reminder in order that they be cautious.","859":"Avoid those who take their religion as playing and an amusement and are seduced by the life of this world. Admonish them hereby lest a soul be taken by what it has gained, for it has no guardian or intercessor before Allah, and though it offers every ransom, it shall not be taken from it. Those are they who are taken for that which they earned. For them a drink of boiling water, a stern punishment for their disbelief.","860":"Say: 'Are we to call, other than Allah, what can neither help nor harm us? Are we to turn on our heels after Allah has guided us like him, who, being bewitched by devils, blunders aimlessly in the earth, although his friends call him to the guidance, (saying) 'Come to us' Say: 'The guidance of Allah is the Guidance. We are commanded to submit to the Lord of the Worlds,","861":"and to establish prayer, and fear Him. Before Him you shall all be assembled'","862":"It was He who created the heavens and the earth in truth. On the Day when He says: 'Be' it shall be. His Word is the truth. His shall be the Kingdom on the Day when the Horn is blown. The Knower of the unseen and the visible, and He is the Wise, the Aware.","863":"(And remember) when Abraham said to his father Azar: 'Will you take idols for gods, surely I see you and your people are in clear error'","864":"And so We showed Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, so that he might be of those who are certain.","865":"When night drew over him, he saw a planet. 'This' he said: 'is surely my Lord' But when it set he said: 'I do not like the setting ones'","866":"When he saw the rising moon, he said: 'This is my Lord' But when it set, he said: 'If my Lord does not guide me, I shall surely be amongst the astray nation'","867":"Then, when he saw the sun rise, shining, he said: 'This must be my Lord, it is larger' But when it set, he said: 'O nation I am quit of what you associate (with Allah, the Creator),","868":"I have turned my face to Him who has created the heavens and the earth, uprightly, and I am not among the idolaters'","869":"His nation argued with him. He said: 'Will you argue with me about Allah, indeed He guided me! Except by His will, I do not fear those you associate with Him. My Lord embraces all things in knowledge, will you not remember?","870":"And how should I fear what you have associated when you yourselves are not afraid that you have associated with Allah that which He did not send down for it upon you an authority. Which of the two parties is more deserving of safety, if you know?","871":"Those who believe and have not confounded their belief with harm security belongs to them; and they are guided'","872":"Such is the argument that We gave Abraham against his nation. We raise whom We will to an exalted rank. Your Lord is Wise, Knowing.","873":"We gave him Isaac and Jacob and guided both; and We guided Noah before them, among his descendants were David and Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses and Aaron as such, We recompense the gooddoers,","874":"and (Prophets) Zachariah, John, Jesus and Elias, each was of the righteous,","875":"and Ishmael, Elisha, Jonah and Lot. Each We preferred above the worlds,","876":"as We did their fathers, their descendants, and their brothers. We chose them and guided them to a Straight Path.","877":"Such is the guidance of Allah by it He guides whom He will of His worshipers. Had they associated (others with Him), their labors would have indeed been annulled.","878":"Those, We have given them the Book, judgment, and prophethood. If these disbelieve it, We have entrusted it to others who do not disbelieve in it.","879":"Those were whom Allah guided. Follow then their guidance and say: 'I do not ask you a wage for it. Surely, it is a reminder to the worlds'","880":"They have not valued Allah with His true value, when they said 'Allah has never sent down anything to a mortal' Say: 'Who, then sent down the Book which Moses brought, a light and guidance for people? You put it on to parchments, revealing them and hiding much, you have now been taught what neither you nor your fathers knew before' Say: 'Allah' Then leave them, playing in their plunging.","881":"And this is a Blessed Book which We have sent down, confirming what came before it, in order that you warn the Mother of the Villages (Mecca) and those who (live) around it. Those who believe in the Everlasting Life believe in it and preserve their prayers.","882":"Who is more harmful than he who invents a lie about Allah, or says: \"It has been revealed to me,\" when nothing has been revealed to him? Or he who says: 'I will send down the like of what Allah has sent down' Would that you could see the harmdoers when death overwhelms them! With hands outstretched, the angels (will say): 'Yield up your souls. You shall be recompensed with a humiliating punishment this Day, for you have said of Allah what is untrue and you grew proud against His verses.","883":"Now you have returned to Us, alone, as We created you at first, leaving behind all that We have bestowed on you. Nor do We see with you your intercessors, those whom you asserted to be your associates. The ties which bound you are broken, and that which you asserted has gone astray from you'","884":"It is Allah who splits the grain and the datestone. He brings forth the living from the dead, and the dead from the living. So, that is Allah; how then are you perverted?","885":"He splits the sky into dawn. He has ordained the night for rest and the sun, and the moon for reckoning. Such is the ordinance of the Almighty, the Knowing.","886":"It is He who has created for you the stars, so that you can be guided by them in the darkness of land and sea. We have made plain Our verses to a nation who know.","887":"It is He who originated you from one soul, then a lodging (place), and then a repository. We have made plain the verses to a nation that understands.","888":"He sends down water from the sky, and with it We bring forth the plant of every thing. From these We bring forth green foliage and composite grain, palmtrees laden with clusters of dates within reach, vineyards and olive groves and pomegranates alike and unlike. Behold their fruits when they bear fruit and ripen. Surely, in these there are signs for a nation who believe.","889":"Yet they regard the jinn as the partners of Allah, although He created them, and without knowledge ascribe to Him sons and daughters. Exaltations to Him! He is above what they describe.","890":"He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth. How can He have a son when He had no female companion?

We have not made you an overseer for them, nor are you their guardian.","897":"Do not say crude words to those who call upon other than Allah, lest they use crude words about Allah in revenge without knowledge. As such we have made the actions of each nation seem pleasing. To their Lord they shall return, and He will inform them of that they were doing.","898":"They solemnly swear by Allah that if a sign is given to them they would believe in it. Say: 'Signs are only with Allah' And how can you tell if it comes they will not believe'","899":"We will turn away their hearts and eyes since they refused to believe in it at first. We will leave them in their insolence wandering blindly.","900":"Even if We sent down the angels to them and the dead spoke to them, and assembled all things in front of them, they would still not believe, unless Allah willed it. But most of them are ignorant.","901":"As such We have assigned for every Prophet an enemy; the satans of humans and jinn, revealing varnished speech to each other, all as a delusion. But had your Lord willed, they would not have done so. Therefore leave them and what they invent,","902":"so that the hearts of those who have no belief in the Everlasting Life are inclined to it and, being pleased, persist in their sinful ways.","903":"Should I seek a judge other than Allah when it is He who has sent down the well distinguished Book for you? Those to whom We have given the Book know that it is the truth sent down from your Lord, so do not be among the doubters.","904":"Perfected are the words of your Lord in truth and justice, none can change His Words. He is the Hearing, the Knowing.","905":"If you obeyed most of those on earth, they would lead you astray from the Path of Allah. They follow only supposition and they are but conjecturing.","906":"Your Lord knows best who stray from His Path and the guided.","907":"Eat then of that over which the Name of Allah has been mentioned (when slaughtered), if you truly believe in His verses.","908":"And why should you not eat of that over which the Name of Allah has been pronounced when He has already made plain to you what is forbidden, except when you are constrained? Many are those who mislead through ignorance on account of their fancies, but your Lord best knows the transgressors.","909":"Forsake the revealed and hidden sin. Those who earn sin shall be recompensed for what they have committed.","910":"Do not eat from that which the Name of Allah has not been mentioned, for it is a sin. The satans will reveal to their guided ones to argue with you. If you obey them, you shall indeed become idolaters.","911":"Is he who was dead whom We have revived and given a light with which he walks among people to be compared to him who blunders about in darkness from which he will never emerge? As such what the unbelievers have done appear decorated to them.","912":"And as such we have placed in every village its archtransgressors to scheme there. But they scheme only against themselves, though they do not sense it.","913":"When a sign came to them they said: 'We will not believe in it unless we are given that which the Messengers of Allah have been given' But Allah knows best where to place His Message. Humiliation with Allah shall befall the sinners as well as a terrible punishment for what they devised.","914":"Whomsoever Allah desires to guide, He expands his chest to Islam (submission). Whomsoever He desires to lead astray, He makes his chest narrow, tight, as though he were climbing to heaven.

We have made plain Our verses to a nation who remember.","916":"Theirs is the abode of peace with their Lord. He is their Guardian for what they did.","917":"On the Day when He assembles them all together, 'O company of Jinn, you have seduced mankind in great numbers' And their guided ones among the humans will say: 'Lord, we have enjoyed each other. But now we have reached the term which You have appointed for us' He will say: 'The Fire shall be your lodging, and there you shall remain for ever except as Allah will' Your Lord is Wise, Knowing.","918":"So We make the harmdoers guides of each other for what they have earned.","919":"'Jinn and human, did there not come to you Messengers of your own who narrated to you My verses and warned you of encountering this Day' They will reply: 'We bear witness against ourselves' Indeed, the life of this world beguiled them. They will bear witness against themselves that they were unbelievers.","920":"That is because your Lord will not destroy villages unjustly, while their inhabitants were inattentive.","921":"They all have their degrees according to their deeds. Your Lord is not inattentive of their actions.","922":"Your Lord is Rich and the Owner of Mercy. He can destroy you if He will and replace you with whom He pleases, just as He raised you from the offspringof other nations.","923":"That which you are promised is sure to come. You shall not frustrate Me.","924":"Say: 'Work according to your station my people, for indeed I am working' You shall know to whom will be the good end of the abode. The harmdoers shall not be triumphant.","925":"They set aside for Allah a share of what He has created of tilth and cattle saying: 'This is for Allah so they claim and this for our associates (gods)' The share of their associates never reaches Allah, but the share of Allah reaches their associates. How evil they judge!","926":"As such their associates made it attractive to the idolaters to kill their children so that they ruin them and confuse them about their religion. But had Allah willed, they would not have done so. Therefore, leave them to their false inventions.","927":"They say: 'These cattle, and these crops are forbidden. None can eat of them except those whom we permit' so they claim 'and cattle whose backs are forbidden, and others over which they do not pronounce the Name of Allah' As such fabricating lies against Him. He will recompense them for their invented lies.","928":"They also say: 'What is in the bellies (wombs) of these cattle is reserved for our males but not for our wives' But if it is stillborn, they all partake of it. He will recompense them for their describing. He is Wise, Knowing.","929":"Lost are those who, without knowledge, have foolishly slain their own children and made unlawful that which Allah has provided them, fabricating lies about Allah. They have gone astray and are not guided.","930":"He brings forth gardens, trellised and untrellised, palmtrees and crops, different to eat, and the olive and pomegranates alike and unlike. When it bears fruit eat of it and pay what is due (the zakat) of it upon the harvest day. But do not be wasteful; He does not love the wasteful.","931":"And of the cattle, some are for carrying burdens, and others for slaughter. Eat of that which Allah has provided you with and do not follow in satan's footsteps; he is your open enemy.","932":"(He has given you) eight couples, a pair of sheep and a pair of goats. Say: 'Of these, has He forbidden you the males, the females, or what the wombs of the two females contain? Tell me with knowledge, if you are truthful'","933":"Then a pair of camels and a pair of cattle. Say: 'Of these, has He forbidden you the males, the females, or what the wombs of the two females contain? Were you witnesses when Allah charged you with this?

Allah does not guide the harmdoers.","934":"Say: 'I find nothing in what has been revealed to me that forbids any one to eat of any food except the dead, running blood, and the flesh of swine for these are unclean and that which has been hallowed in its slaughter to other than Allah. But whoever is constrained to eat of any of these, not intending to sin or transgress, then your Lord is Forgiving, the Most Merciful.","935":"We forbade the Jews all with undivided hoofs and the fat of sheep and cattle, except what is on their backs and entrails, and what is mixed with their bones. As such We recompensed them for their transgress ions. Indeed, We are truthful.","936":"If they belie you, say: 'Your Lord is the Owner of all Encompassing Mercy, but His Might cannot be withheld from the nation, the evildoers'","937":"The idolaters will say: 'Had Allah willed, neither we nor our fathers would have associated (idols), nor would we have forbidden anything.

You follow nothing but guessing and you are only speakers of conjecture'","938":"Say: 'Allah alone has the conclusive proof.

Shall they not be recompensed except for what they used to do?","1102":"In his absence, the nation of Moses made a calf from their ornaments, a body with a hollow sound. Did they not see that it could neither speak to them, nor guide them to a path? Yet they took it in worship and were harmdoers.","1103":"But when it landed in their hands and saw that they had strayed, they said: 'If our Lord does not have mercy on us and forgive us, we shall be lost'","1104":"And when Moses returned to his nation, angry and sorrowful, he said: 'Evil is what you have done in my absence! Would you hasten the retribution of your Lord' He threw down the Tablets, and seizing his brother by the head, dragged him towards him. 'Son of my mother' said (Aaron), 'the nation weakened me, and almost killed me. Do not let my enemies rejoice over me; do not number me among the harmdoers.'","1105":"'Lord' said Moses, 'forgive me and forgive my brother. Admit us to Your Mercy, for You are Most Merciful of the merciful'","1106":"Those who worshipped the calf incurred the Anger of their Lord and abasement in this life, and as such We recompense the forgers.","1107":"As for those who do evil and later repent and believe, your Lord is Forgiving, the Most Merciful thereafter.","1108":"When his anger abated, Moses took up the Tablets upon which was inscribed guidance and mercy to those who fear their Lord.","1109":"Moses chose from among his nation seventy men for Our appointment, and when the quake seized them, Moses said: 'My Lord, had it been Your Will, You would have destroyed them before, and me.

And when his people demanded drink, We revealed to Moses: 'Strike the rock with your staff' Thereupon twelve springs gushed from the rock and each tribe knew its drinkingplace. We caused the clouds to cast their shadow over them, and sent down for them manna and quails, saying: 'Eat of the good things We have provided for you' Indeed, they did Us no wrong, but they wronged themselves.","1115":"When it was said to them: 'Dwell in this village, and eat of whatever you please; and say, \"Unburdening\" and enter the gate prostrating, We will forgive you your sins and increase the gooddoers'","1116":"The wicked amongst them changed what was said for other words. Therefore We sent down upon them from heaven a punishment for their evil doing.","1117":"Ask them about the village that overlooked the sea and what befell (its people) when they broke the Sabbath. Each Sabbath, their fish came swimming towards the shore, but on other days they did not come to them. As such We tempted them (the people) because they had done wrong.","1118":"And when some asked: 'Why do you admonish a nation whom Allah will destroy or sternly punish' They replied: '(Seeking) a pardon from your Lord, and in order that they may be cautious'","1119":"Therefore, when they forgot that of which they were reminded, We saved those who were forbidding evil, and seized the evildoers with an evil punishment for that which they used to do of evil.","1120":"And when they had scornfully persisted in what they had been forbidden, We said to them: 'Be apes, despised'","1121":"Then your Lord declared He would send against them he who would oppress them cruelly till the Day of Resurrection. Swift is the retribution of your Lord, yet surely He is Forgiving, the Most Merciful.","1122":"We dispersed them through the earth in nations some were righteous, others were not, and tested them with good and evil in order that they return.","1123":"Then others succeeded them who inherited the Book and availed themselves of the vanities of this lower world, saying: 'It will be forgiven us' But if similar vanities came their way, they would again take them. Have they not taken the covenant of the Book, which they have studied, to tell nothing of Allah except what is true? Surely, the Everlasting Life is better for the cautious, do you not understand!","1124":"As for those who hold fast to the Book and are steadfast in prayer, We do not waste the wage of the righteous.","1125":"When We suspended the mountain over them as though it were a shadow and they feared that it was falling down on them: (We said): 'Take forcefully that which We have given you and remember what it contains, in order that you keep from evil'","1126":"When your Lord brought forth descendants from the loins of Adam's children, and made them testify concerning themselves (He said): 'Am I not your Lord.' They replied: 'We bear witness (that You are)' Lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection: 'We had no knowledge of this'","1127":"or you say: 'Our forefathers were idolaters before, and we were the descendants after them, will You destroy us for the deeds of the vaindoers'","1128":"As such We make plain Our verses in order that they return.","1129":"Recite to them the news of he to whom We gave Our verses and who turned away from them; how satan overtook him so he was led astray.","1130":"Had it been Our will We would have raised with it, but he clung to this earthly life and succumbed to his fancies. His likeness was that of a dog, whether you chase it away or let it alone it pants. Such is the example of a nation who belie Our signs. Recount to them these narratives, in order that they reflect.","1131":"Evil is the example of those who belied Our verses; they wronged themselves.","1132":"He whom Allah guides is one that is guided, but he whom Allah leaves in error shall surely be the lost.","1133":"For Gehenna, We have created many jinn and many humans. They have hearts, with which they cannot understand; eyes, with which they do not see; and ears, with which they do not hear. They are like cattle, rather, they are the more misguided. Such are the heedless.","1134":"To Allah belongs the Finest Names, so call Him by them, and keep away from those who pervert them. They shall be recompensed for the things they did.","1135":"Among those whom We created there is a nation who guide with the truth and with it they are just.","1136":"As for those who belie Our verses, We will draw them on little by little, from where they cannot tell;","1137":"and I respite them, My stratagem is firm.","1138":"Have they not reflected? There is no madness in their companion, he is but a plain warner.","1139":"Will they not ponder upon the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and all that Allah created, and that it may be that their term is drawing near? So, in which speech will they believe thereafter?","1140":"None can guide those whom Allah leaves in error. He leaves them in their insolence, wandering blindly.","1141":"They ask you about the Hour and when it is to come. Say: 'None knows except my Lord. He alone will reveal it at the appointed time. It is heavy in the heavens and earth. It will not come to you but suddenly' They will question you, as though you had full knowledge of it. Say: 'Its knowledge is with Allah, though most people are unaware'","1142":"Say: 'I do not have the power to acquire benefits or to avert harm from myself, except by the Will of Allah. Had I possessed knowledge of the unseen, I would have availed myself of much that is good, and no harm would have touched me. But I am only a warner and a bearer of glad tidings for a nation who believe.","1143":"It is He who created you from a soul. From it He created its mate, so that he might reside with her. And when he had covered her, she conceived, and for a time her burden was light. She carried it with ease, but when it grew heavy, they both supplicated to Allah, their Lord: 'Grant us a goodly child and we will be among the thankful'","1144":"Yet when He gave both of them (the parents) a goodly child, they set up associates with Him, in return for what He had given them. Exalted be Allah above that they associate with Him.","1145":"Will they associate that which cannot create a thing while they are created?","1146":"They cannot help them, nor can they help themselves.","1147":"If you call them to guidance, they will not follow you. It is the same whether you call them or you are silent.","1148":"Those whom you invoke, other than Allah, are worshipers like yourselves. Call them, and let them answer you, if what you say is true!","1149":"Have they feet to walk with? Have they hands to punish with? Have they eyes to see with? Have they ears to hear with?

He guards the righteous.","1151":"Those whom you invoke, other than Him, cannot help you, nor can they help themselves'","1152":"If you call them to guidance, they will not hear you. You see them looking towards you, but they cannot see.","1153":"Accept the easing, order with fine jurisprudence, and avoid the ignorant.","1154":"When satan provokes you seek refuge in Allah; He is the Hearing, the Knowing.","1155":"Indeed, when a visitation of satan touches the cautious (worshipers) they remember, and then see clearly.","1156":"And their brothers, they prolong them in error, and they will never stop.","1157":"When you do not bring them a verse, they say, 'Why have you not chosen one' Say: 'I follow only what is revealed to me from my Lord. This (Koran) is a veritable proof from your Lord, guidance and mercy for people who believe'","1158":"When the Koran is recited, listen to it in silence in order that Allah has mercy upon you.","1159":"Remember your Lord in your soul with humility and fear, and not with a loud voice, morning and evening, and do not be among the inattentive.","1160":"Those who are with your Lord are not too proud to worship Him. They exalt Him and to Him they prostrate.","1161":"They ask you about the spoils (of war). Say: 'The spoils belong to Allah and the Messenger. Therefore, have fear of Allah and set things right between you. Obey Allah and His Messenger, if you are believers'","1162":"Indeed the believers are those whose hearts quake at the mention of Allah, and when His verses are recited to them it increased them in faith. They are those who put their trust in their Lord.","1163":"Those who pray steadfastly, and spend of that which We have provided them,","1164":"those are, in truth, the believers. They shall have degrees with their Lord and forgiveness, and a generous provision.","1165":"It is like when your Lord caused you to leave your home with the truth, though some of the believers disliked it.","1166":"They argued with you about the truth after it had been made clear, as though they were being led to certain death while looking.","1167":"(Remember) when Allah promised to grant you one of the two parties (at Badr), and you wished for the one that was not strong. Allah wanted to establish the truth by His Words and to sever the unbelievers to the last,","1168":"in order that He might verify the truth and annul the falsehood, even though the wrongdoers hated it.","1169":"And when you (Prophet Muhammad) prayed to your Lord for help, He answered: 'I am sending to your aid a thousand angels in succession'","1170":"Allah only made it to be glad tidings and so that your hearts may be satisfied; victory comes only from Allah; He is Almighty, Wise.","1171":"When you were overcome by sleep, as security from Him, He sent down water from the sky to cleanse you and to purify you of satan's filth, to strengthen your hearts and to steady your footsteps.","1172":"And when Allah revealed to the angels, saying: 'I shall be with you. Give courage to the believers. I shall cast terror into the hearts of the unbelievers. Strike them above the necks, smite their finger tips'","1173":"This is because they had made a breach with Allah and His Messenger. He who makes a breach with Allah and His Messenger indeed, Allah is stern in retribution.","1174":"'That for you, so taste it, the punishment of the Fire is for the unbelievers'","1175":"Believers, when you encounter unbelievers on the march do not turn your backs to them in flight.","1176":"If anyone on that day turns his back to them in flight, except when maneuvering to fight, or to join another party, he shall be laden with the Anger of Allah and Gehenna shall be his refuge an evil arrival.","1177":"It was not you who killed them, but Allah slew them, neither was it you who threw at them. Allah threw at them in order that He confers on the believers a fair benefit. Indeed, Allah is Hearing, Knowing.","1178":"Allah will surely weaken the guile of the unbelievers.","1179":"If you were seeking a victory, victory has now come to you. If you desist, it will be better for you. If you resume We will return, and even if your forces are numerous, they shall not help you at all. And Allah is with the believers.","1180":"Believers, obey Allah and His Messenger, and do not turn away from him when you are hearing.","1181":"Do not be like those who say: 'We hear' but they do not listen.","1182":"The worst beasts before Allah are those who are deaf, dumb, and do not understand.","1183":"Indeed, had Allah known any good in them, He would have let them hear. But even if He had made them hear, they would have turned away, swerving aside.","1184":"Believers, respond to Allah and the Messenger when he calls you to that which revives you. Know that Allah is between the person and his heart, and that toHim you shall all be gathered.","1185":"And be cautious against a sedition that will not smite the harmdoers alone. Know that the punishment of Allah is Stern.","1186":"And remember how He gave you shelter when you were few in number and considered weak in the land, ever fearing that the people would snatch you away; but He gave you refuge and supported you with His victory and provided you with goodness, so that you might give thanks.","1187":"Believers, do not betray Allah and the Messenger, nor knowingly betray your trust.","1188":"Know that your children and your wealth are but a temptation, and that the reward with Allah is great.","1189":"Believers, if you fear Allah, He will give you a criteria and cleanse you of your sins and forgive you. Allah is the Owner of great bounty.","1190":"And when the unbelievers plotted against you (Prophet Muhammad). They sought to either take you captive or have you killed, or expelled. They plotted but Allah (in reply) also plotted. Allah is the Best in plotting.","1191":"Whenever Our verses are recited to them, they say: 'We have heard them, if we wished, we could speak its like. They are but tales of the ancients'","1192":"When they say: 'O Allah, if this is indeed the truth from You, rain down upon us stones from heaven or bring us a painful punishment.'","1193":"But Allah was not to punish them whilst you were living in their midst. Nor would Allah punish them if they repeatedly ask forgiveness of Him.","1194":"And why should Allah not punish them, when they have barred others from the Sacred Mosque, although they were not its guardians? Its only guardians are the cautious, though most of them do not know.","1195":"Their prayers at the Sacred House are nothing but whistling and clapping. Therefore, taste the punishment for your disbelief.","1196":"Those who disbelieve spend their wealth to bar (others) from the Path of Allah. They will spend it; but it will become a regret for them, then they will be overcome. The unbelievers shall be gathered in Gehenna,","1197":"in order that Allah will separate the wicked from the good. He will heap the wicked one upon another, and then heap them together and cast them in Gehenna those shall be the losers.","1198":"Tell the unbelievers that if they abandon their ways He will forgive them what is past; but, if they return, that was indeed the way of their forefathers who have passed away.","1199":"Fight them until persecution is no more and the Religion of Allah reigns supreme. If they desist, Allah sees the things they do;","1200":"but if they turn away, know that Allah is your guardian, (He is) the best Guardian and the best Giver of victory.","1201":"And know that one fifth of whatever you take as spoils belong to Allah, the Messenger, kinsmen of the Messenger, the orphans, the needy, and the destitute traveler; if you believe in Allah and what We sent down to Our worshiper on the day of victory, the day when the two armies met. Allah has power over all things.","1202":"And when you were encamped on the nearside and they (the unbelievers) on the farther side, with the caravan below, had you made an appointment with them, you would have surely failed to keep it; but Allah sought to accomplish what He had ordained, so that by clear evidence, he who was destined to perish might perish, and he who was destined to live might live. Surely, Allah is Hearing, Knowing.","1203":"And when Allah made them appear to you in a vision as a small band, had He showed them to you as many, your courage would have failed you and you would have quarreled over the affair. But Allah saved; He knows the inner most thoughts in the chests.","1204":"And when you met them, He showed them in your eyes as being few, and decreased (your number) in their eyes so that Allah might determine what was ordained. To Allah all matters return.","1205":"Believers, when you meet an army stand firm and remember Allah abundantly, in order that you are prosperous.","1206":"Obey Allah and His Messenger and do not dispute with one another lest you should lose courage and your resolve weaken. Have patience Allah is with those who are patient.","1207":"Do not be like those who left their homes elated with insolence and showing off to people, barring others from the Path of Allah but Allah encompasses what they do.","1208":"And when satan made their foul deeds seem fair to them. He said: 'No one shall conquer you this day. I shall be your savior' But when the two armies came within sight of each other, he took to his heels, saying: 'I reject you, for I can see what you cannot. I fear Allah, Allah is Stern in retribution'","1209":"And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts was sickness said: 'Those, their religion has deceived them' But whosoever puts his trust in Allah, indeed Allah is Mighty, Wise.","1210":"If you could see the angels when they carry off the souls of the unbelievers, beating their faces and their backs, saying: 'Taste the punishment of Burning!","1211":"That is for what your hands have forwarded, Allah is not unjust to His worshipers'","1212":"Like Pharaoh's family and those who have gone before them, they disbelieved the signs of Allah. Therefore, Allah seized them in their sinfulness. Mighty is Allah and stern in retribution.","1213":"This is because Allah would never change His favor that He bestowed upon a nation until they change what is in their hearts. Allah is Hearing, Knowing.","1214":"Like Pharaoh's family and those who have gone before them, they belied the signs of their Lord, and so We destroyed them for their sins and drowned Pharaoh's family. They were all harmdoers.","1215":"Indeed, the basest creatures before Allah are the unbelievers for they will not believe;","1216":"those with whom you have made a treaty, then break their treaty with you every time; having no fear (of Allah),","1217":"if you meet them in battle, cause their example to scatter those behind them so that they remember.","1218":"If you fear treachery from any of your allies, you can dissolve with them equally. Allah does not love the treacherous.","1219":"Do not suppose that the unbelievers have outstripped (Allah). They cannot frustrate Me.","1220":"Muster against them whatever you are able of force and tethers (ropes) of horses, so that you strike terror into the enemies of Allah and your enemy, and others besides them whom you do not know but Allah does. All that you spend in the Way of Allah shall be repaid to you. You shall not be wronged.","1221":"If they incline to peace, incline to it also, and put your trust in Allah. Surely, He is the Hearing, the Knowing.","1222":"Should they seek to deceive you, Allah is sufficient for you. It is He who supported you with His victory and with believers,","1223":"and brought their hearts together. If you had given away all the riches of the earth, you could not have so united them, but Allah has united them. He isAlmighty, Wise.","1224":"O Prophet, Allah suffices you and whosoever follows you of the believers.","1225":"O Prophet, urge the believers to fight. If there are twenty patient men among you, you shall overcome two hundred, and if there are a hundred, they shall overcome a thousand unbelievers, for they are a nation who do not understand.","1226":"Allah has now lightened it for you, for He knows that there is weakness amongst you. If there are a hundred patient men among you, they shall overcome two hundred; and if there are a thousand, they shall, by the permission of Allah, defeat two thousand. Allah is with the patient.","1227":"It is not for any Prophet to have prisoners in order to slaughter many in the land. You want the gains of this life, and Allah wants the Everlasting Life, and Allah is Mighty, Wise.","1228":"Had there not been a previous writing from Allah, you would have been afflicted by a mighty punishment.","1229":"Eat of what you have taken from the spoils; such is lawful and good, and fear Allah. Allah is Forgiving and Most Merciful.","1230":"O Prophet, say to those you have taken captive in your hand: 'If Allah finds goodness in your hearts, He will give you that which is better than what has been taken from you, and He will forgive you. Allah is Forgiving, the Most Merciful'","1231":"But if they seek to betray you, they had betrayed Allah before, but He has let you overcome them. Allah is the Knower, the Wise.","1232":"Those who believe and migrated, and fought for the Cause of Allah with their wealth and their persons; and those who sheltered them and helped them shall be guides to each other. And those who believe, but have not emigrated you have no guidance towards them till they emigrate. But if they seek your help in the cause of your religion, it is your duty to help them, except against a nation with whom you have a treaty. Allah sees the things you do.","1233":"The unbelievers, they are guides of one another. Unless you do this, there will be persecution in the land and great corruption.","1234":"Those who believe and migrated from their homes and fought for the Way of Allah, and those who have sheltered them and helped them they are truly the believers. Theirs shall be forgiveness and a generous provision.","1235":"And those who believed afterwards and emigrated, and struggled with you they are of you. And in the Book of Allah, the near kinsmen deserve one another (in inheritance). Allah has knowledge of all things.","1236":"An acquittal from Allah and His Messenger to the idolaters with whom you have made agreements;","1237":"'For four months you shall journey freely in the land. But know that you shall not render Allah incapable, and that Allah will humiliate the unbelievers'","1238":"A proclamation from Allah and His Messenger, to the people on the day of the Grand Pilgrimage; 'Allah rejects, and His Messenger (rejects) the idolaters. So if you repent, that will be better for you; but if you turn your backs, know that you cannot frustrate Allah. And give glad tidings to the unbelievers of a painful punishment,","1239":"except those idolaters who have fully honored their treaties with you and aided none against you. With these fulfill your covenant till their term. Surely, Allah loves the righteous.","1240":"When the sacred months are over, slay the idolaters wherever you find them. Take them and confine them, then lie in ambush everywhere for them. If they repent and establish the prayer and pay the obligatory charity, let them go their way. Allah is Forgiving and the Most Merciful.","1241":"If an idolater seeks asylum with you, give him protection in order that he hears the Word of Allah, and then convey him to his place of safety, because they are a nation who do not know.","1242":"How can the idolaters have any treaty with Allah and His Messenger, except those with whom you have made treaties by the Sacred Mosque? So long as they are straight with you, so be straight with them. Allah loves the righteous.","1243":"How? If they prevail against you they will respect neither agreements nor ties of kindred. They satisfy you with their tongues, but their hearts are averse; and most of them are wicked.","1244":"They sell the verses of Allah for a small price and bar others from His Path. Evil is what they have been doing.","1245":"They honor with the believers neither bonds nor treaties. Such are the transgressors.","1246":"If they repent and establish the prayer and pay the obligatory charity, they shall become your brothers in the religion. So We make plain Our verses for a nation that knows.","1247":"But if, after coming to terms with you, they break their oaths and revile your belief, fight the leaders of the disbelief for they have no oaths in order that they will desist.","1248":"Will you not fight against those who have broken their oaths and conspired to expel the Messenger? They were the first to attack you. Do you fear them? Surely, Allah has better rights that you fear Him, if you are believers.","1249":"Fight them, Allah will punish them with your hands and degrade them. He will grant you victory over them and heal the chests of a believing nation.","1250":"He will take away all anger from their hearts: Allah turns to whomsoever He will. Allah is Knowing, Wise.","1251":"Did you suppose that you would be left before Allah has known those of you who fought and did not take a confidant other than Allah, His Messenger, and the believers? Allah is Aware of what you do.","1252":"Idolaters should not inhabit the mosques of Allah bearing witness against themselves with disbelief. Those, their deeds have been annulled, and in the Fire they shall live for ever.","1253":"None should inhabit the mosques of Allah except those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, establish their prayers and pay the obligatory charity, and fear none except Allah. May these be among the guided.","1254":"Do you consider giving drink to the pilgrims and inhabiting the Sacred Mosque is the same as one who believes in Allah and the Last Day, and struggles in the Way of Allah? These are not held equal by Allah. Allah does not guide the harmdoers.","1255":"Those who believe, and migrated, and struggle in the Way of Allah with their wealth and their persons are greater in rank with Allah. It is they who are the winners.","1256":"Their Lord gives them glad tidings of mercy from Him, and pleasure; for them await gardens in which there is eternal bliss.","1257":"where they shall live for ever. The wage with Allah is great indeed.","1258":"Believers, do not take your fathers or your brothers for a guide if they love disbelief rather than belief. Whosoever of you takes them for guides are the harmdoers.","1259":"Say: 'If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your tribes, the property you have acquired, the merchandise you fear will not be sold, and the homes you love, are dearer to you than Allah, His Messenger and the struggling for His Way, then wait until Allah shall bring His command. Allah does not guide the evildoers'","1260":"Allah has helped you on many a battlefield. In the Battle of Hunain, when your numbers were pleasing you they availed you nothing; the earth, for all its vastness, seemed to close in upon you and you turned your backs and fled.","1261":"Then, Allah caused His tranquility (sechina) to descend upon His Messenger and the believers; He sent legions you did not see and sternly punished the unbelievers. Such is the recompense of the unbelievers.","1262":"Yet thereafter, Allah turns to whom He will. He is the Forgiving, the Most Merciful.","1263":"Believers, the idolaters are unclean. Do not let them approach the Sacred Mosque after this year. If you fear poverty, Allah, if He wills, will enrich you through His bounty. He is Knowing, Wise.","1264":"Fight those who neither believe in Allah nor the Last Day, who do not forbid what Allah and His Messenger have forbidden, and do not embrace the religion of the truth, being among those who have been given the Book (Bible and the Torah), until they pay tribute out of hand and have been humiliated.","1265":"The Jews say Ezra is the son of Allah, while the Christians (who follow Paul) say the Messiah is the son of Allah. Such are their assertions, by which they imitate those who disbelieved before. Allah fights them! How perverted are they!","1266":"They take their rabbis and monks as lords besides Allah, and the Messiah, son of Mary, though they were ordered to worship but one God, there is no god except He. Exalted is He above that they associate with Him!","1267":"They desire to extinguish the Light of Allah with their mouths; but Allah seeks only to perfect His Light, though the unbelievers hate it.","1268":"It is He who has sent forth His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to uplift it above every religion, no matter how much the idolaters hate it.","1269":"Believers, many are the rabbis and monks who in falsehood defraud people of their possessions and bar people from the Path of Allah. Give glad tidings of a painful punishment to those who treasure gold and silver and do not spend it in the Way of Allah.","1270":"On that Day they (the treasures) will be heated in the fire of Gehenna (Hell), and their foreheads, sides, and backs will be branded with them, and told: 'These are the things which you have treasured. Taste then that which you were treasuring'","1271":"The number of the months, with Allah, is twelve in the Book of Allah, the day when He created the heavens and the earth; of these, four are sacred. That is the right religion. Therefore, do not wrong yourselves in them and fight against the unbelievers all together as they themselves fight against you all together; know that Allah is with the cautious.","1272":"The postponement of sacred months is an increase in disbelief in which the unbelievers are misguided. They allow it one year and forbid it another year, so that they can make up for the months that Allah has sanctified so making lawful what Allah has forbidden. Their foul acts seem fair to them Allah does not guide the unbelievers.","1273":"Believers, why is it that when it is said to you: 'March in the Way of Allah' you linger with heaviness in the land? Are you content with this life rather than theEverlasting Life? Yet the enjoyment of this life in (comparison to) the Everlasting Life is little.","1274":"If you do not go forth, He will punish you with a painful punishment and replace you by another nation. You will in no way harm Him; for Allah has power over all things.","1275":"If you do not help him, Allah will help him as He helped him when he was driven out with one other (Abu Bakr) by the unbelievers. When the two were in the cave, he said to his companion: 'Do not sorrow, Allah is with us' Then Allah caused His tranquility (shechina) to descend upon him and supported him with legions (of angels) you did not see, and He made the word of the unbelievers the lowest, and the Word of Allah is the highest. Allah is Mighty, Wise.","1276":"Whether lightly or heavily, march on and fight for the Way of Allah, with your wealth and your persons. This will be best for you, if you but knew.","1277":"Had the gain been immediate or the journey easy, they would have followed you; but the distance seemed far to them. Yet they will swear by Allah: 'Had we been able, we would have gone out with you' They bring destruction upon their souls. Allah knows that they are lying.","1278":"Allah has forgiven you! Why did you give them leave (to stay behind) until it was clear to you which of them was truthful and knew those who lied?","1279":"Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day will not ask your permission so that they may struggle with their wealth and their selves. Allah knows best the righteous.","1280":"Only those who ask your permission do not believe in Allah and the Last Day and whose hearts are filled with doubt. And in their doubt, they waiver.","1281":"Had they intended to set forth with you, they would have prepared themselves for it. But Allah did not like their going forth and held them back, and it was said: 'Stay back with those who stay back'","1282":"Had they gone forth among you, they would only have increased your burden, and run to and fro in your midst, seeking to stir up sedition between you; and some of you would listen to them; and Allah knows the harmdoers.","1283":"Beforehand they had already sought to stir up sedition, and turned things upside down for you, until the truth came, and the command of Allah appeared, although they were averse.","1284":"Among them are some that say: 'Give us leave and do not expose us to temptation' Surely, they have already succumbed to temptation. Gehenna shall encompass the unbelievers.","1285":"If good comes to you, it grieves them; but if hardship befalls you, they say: 'We have taken our precautions' and they turn away, rejoicing.","1286":"Say: 'Nothing will befall us except what Allah has ordained. He is our Guardian. In Allah, let the believers put their trust'","1287":"Say: 'Are you waiting for anything to befall us except one of the two excellent things (victory or martyrdom)? We are waiting for the punishment of Allah to smite you, either from Him or at our hands. Wait if you will, we are waiting'","1288":"Say: 'Whether you spend voluntarily or reluctantly it shall not be accepted from you; for you are a wicked nation'","1289":"Nothing prevents their offerings from being accepted except that they do not believe in Allah and His Messenger. They do not come to the prayer except lazily and spend grudgingly.","1290":"Let neither their wealth nor their children please you. Through these Allah seeks to punish them in this life, and that their souls depart while they are unbelievers.","1291":"They swear by Allah that they belong with you, yet they are not of you. They are a nation that are afraid.","1292":"If they could find a shelter or caverns, or any place to creep into they will turn stampeding to it.","1293":"There are some among them who find fault with you concerning the distribution of alms. If a share is given to them they are contented, but if they receive nothing then they are angry.","1294":"Would that they were wellpleased with what Allah and His Messenger have given them, and would say: 'Allah is sufficient for us. Allah will provide for us from His abundance, and so will His Messenger. To Allah, we hope'","1295":"The obligatory charity shall be only for the poor and the needy, and for those who work to collect it, and to influence hearts (to belief), for ransoming captives, and debtors in the Way of Allah and the destitute traveler. It is an obligation from Allah. Allah is Knowing, Wise.","1296":"And there are others among them who hurt the Prophet saying: 'He lends an ear (to everything)' Say: 'He lends an ear of good for you; he believes in Allah and trusts the believers, and he is a mercy to the believers among you. Those who hurt the Messenger of Allah for them there is a painful punishment'","1297":"They swear in the Name of Allah in order to please you. But it is more just that they should please Allah and His Messenger if they are believers.","1298":"Are they not aware that whosoever opposes Allah and His Messenger shall live for ever in the Fire of Gehenna? That surely is the greatest degradation.","1299":"The hypocrites are afraid lest a chapter be sent down against them telling them what is in their hearts. Say: 'Mock if you will; Allah will surely bring forth what you are fearing'","1300":"If you question them, they will say: 'We were only plunging and playing' Say: 'Were you mocking Allah, His verses, and His Messenger?","1301":"Do not make excuses. You have disbelieved after you believed. If we forgive some of you, We will punish others, for they were sinners'","1302":"Be they men or women, the hypocrites are all alike. They order what is evil, forbid what is just, and tighten their purse strings. They forsook Allah, so Allah forsook them. Surely, the hypocrites are evildoers.","1303":"Allah has promised the hypocrites, both men and women, and the unbelievers the Fire of Gehenna. They shall live in it for ever. It is sufficient for them. Allah has cursed them and for them is a lasting punishment.","1304":"You are like those before you. They were stronger than you in might, and had greater riches and more children. They took enjoyment in their share, so do you take enjoyment in your share as those before you took enjoyment in their share. You have plunged as they plunged. Those, their works are annulled, failed in this world and in the Everlasting Life, those, they are the losers.","1305":"Have they not heard the news of those who have gone before them? The news of the nations of Noah, Aad and Thamood, of Abraham's nation, and the people of Midian and the ruined cities? Their Messengers showed them clear signs. Allah did not harm them, but they harmed themselves.","1306":"The believers, both men and women, are guides to each other. They order what is just and forbid what is evil; they establish their prayers and pay the obligatory charity and obey Allah and His Messenger. On these Allah will have mercy. He is Mighty, Wise.","1307":"Allah has promised the believing men and women gardens underneath which rivers flow, in which they shall live for ever. Goodly mansions in the Gardens of Eden, and the pleasure from Allah which is greater. That is the greatest winning.","1308":"O Prophet, struggle with the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh with them. Gehenna shall be their refuge an evil arrival.","1309":"They swear by Allah that they said nothing. Yet they did utter the word of disbelief and disbelieved after they had submitted. They intended what they never attained to, and took revenge only that Allah enriched them, and His Messenger, of His Bounty. If they repent, it will indeed be better for them; but if they turn away, Allah will sternly punish them both in this world and in the Everlasting Life. They have none on earth to protect or help them.","1310":"Some of them have made a covenant with Allah, 'If Allah gives to us of His bounty, we will give charity and be of the righteous'","1311":"But when Allah had bestowed His bounty on them they became greedy and turned away, swerving aside.","1312":"He has caused hypocrisy to be in their hearts till the Day they meet Him, because they have changed what they promised Allah and because they were liars.","1313":"Did they not know that Allah knows their secret and what they conspire together, and that Allah knows all the unseen?","1314":"As for those who taunt the believers who give charity voluntarily, and scoff at those who give according to their means, Allah will scoff at them. Theirs shall be a painful punishment.","1315":"(It is the same) whether or not you beg forgiveness for them. If you beg forgiveness for them seventy times Allah will not forgive them, for they have disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger. Allah does not guide the evildoers.","1316":"Those who were left behind were glad that they were left behind by the Messenger of Allah, for they disliked to struggle in the Way of Allah with their wealth and their persons. They said: 'Do not go forth in the heat' Say: 'The Fire of Gehenna is more hot' Would that they understood!","1317":"They shall laugh but little and shed many tears. So shall they be recompensed for their earnings.","1318":"If Allah brings you back to a party of them and they ask permission to march with you, say: 'You shall never march with me, nor shall you fight with me against any enemy. You were pleased to remain on the first occasion, therefore, you shall now stay with those who remain behind'","1319":"You shall never pray over any one of them when he is dead, nor stand over his tomb. For they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger and died whilst they were sinners.","1320":"Let neither their riches nor their children please you. With it Allah wants to punish them in this life, so that their souls depart while they disbelieve.","1321":"Whenever a chapter is sent down, saying: 'Believe in Allah and struggle with His Messenger' the rich among them asked you to excuse them, saying: 'Leave us with those who are to stay behind'","1322":"They were content to be with those who stayed behind, a seal was set upon their hearts, so they do not understand.","1323":"But the Messenger and those who believed with him struggled with their wealth and their selves For them awaits goodness and those are the winners.","1324":"Allah has prepared for them gardens underneath which rivers flow, in which they shall live for ever. That is the greatest winning.","1325":"Some Arabs of the desert who had an excuse came asking permission to stay behind; whilst those who belied Allah and His Messenger remained behind. A painful punishment shall fall on those of them that disbelieved.","1326":"There is no fault for the weak, the sick, and those lacking the means to spend (to stay behind), if they are true to Allah and His Messenger. There is no way against the righteous; Allah is Forgiving, the Most Merciful.","1327":"Nor shall those who came to you to be provided with mounts. And when you said: 'I can find no mounts for you' they turned back, their eyes streaming with tears grieving that they could not find the means to spend.","1328":"But the blame is to be laid on those who asked permission of you whilst they are rich. They are content to remain with those who stay behind. Allah has set a seal upon their hearts so they do not know.","1329":"When you return, they will apologize to you. Say: 'Make no excuses; we will not believe you. Allah has already told us of your news. Surely, Allah and His Messenger will see your work; then you will be returned to the Knower of the unseen and the visible, and He will inform you of what you were doing'","1330":"When you return to them, they will swear to you by Allah that you might turn aside from them. Let them alone, they are unclean. Gehenna shall be their refuge, a recompense for their earnings.","1331":"They will swear to you in order to please you. But if you will be pleased with them, Allah will not be pleased with the evildoing nation.","1332":"The Bedouin Arabs surpass (the city dwellers) in disbelief and hypocrisy, and are more likely not to know the bounds that Allah has sent down to His Messenger. But Allah is Knowing, Wise.","1333":"Some Arabs (Banu Asad and Ghatfan tribes) regard what they spend as a (compulsory) fine and wait for some misfortune to befall you. Theirs shall be the evil turn! Allah is Hearing, Knowing.","1334":"Yet there are some Arabs (Juhaina and Muszaina tribes) who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and regard what they spend as a means of bringing them close to Allah and to the prayers of the Messenger. Indeed, they are an offering for them; Allah will admit them to His Mercy. He is Forgiving, Merciful.","1335":"As for the first outstrippers among the migrants and supporters and those who followed them in doing good, Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. He has prepared for them gardens underneath which rivers flow, where they shall live for ever. That is the greatest winning.","1336":"Some of the Bedouin Arabs around you are hypocrites, and so are some of the people of Madinah who are well versed in hypocrisy. You do not know them, but We do. Twice We will punish them then they shall return to a mighty punishment.","1337":"There are others who have confessed their sins; they intermixed good deeds with another evil. It may be that Allah will turn towards them in mercy. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.","1338":"Take charity from their wealth, in order that they are thereby cleansed and purified, and pray for them; for your prayer is a comforting mercy for them. Allah is Hearing, Knowing.","1339":"Do they not know that Allah accepts the repentance of His worshipers and takes their charity, and that Allah is the Forgiving, the Merciful?","1340":"Say: 'Allah will see your works and so will His Messenger and the believers; then you shall be returned to the Knower of the unseen and the visible, and He will inform you of what you were doing'","1341":"There are others who must wait for the Commandment of Allah. He will either punish or turn towards them. And Allah is Knowing, Wise.","1342":"And there are those who have taken a mosque to cause harm, disbelief, and to divide the believers, and as a place of ambush for those who fought Allah and His Messenger before. They swear: 'We desired nothing but good', but Allah bears witness that they are liars.","1343":"You shall never stand there. A mosque founded upon piety from the first day is worthier for you to stand in. In it are men who love to purify themselves. Allah loves those who purify themselves.","1344":"Is he who founds his building on the fear of Allah and His pleasure, better or he who founds his building on the brink of a crumbling edge so that it will tumble with him into the Fire of Gehenna? Allah does not guide the harmdoers.","1345":"The buildings they have built will always cause doubt in their hearts, unless their hearts are torn into pieces. Allah is Knowing, Wise.","1346":"Allah has purchased from the believers their selves and possessions, and for them is Paradise. They fight in the Way of Allah, slay, and are slain. That is a binding promise upon Him in the Torah, the Gospel and the Koran; and who is there that more truthfully fulfills his covenant than Allah? Therefore, rejoice in the bargain you have bargained with Him. That is the mighty winning.","1347":"Those who repent, those who worship Allah and praise (Him); those who journey, those who bow, those who prostrate themselves; those who order righteousness and forbid evil, and those who observe the limits of Allah give glad tidings to the believers.","1348":"It is not for the Prophet or the believers to ask forgiveness for idolaters, even though they are near kindred, after it has become clear that they are the inhabitants of Hell.","1349":"Abraham only asked for forgiveness for his father because of a promise he had made to him. But when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of Allah, he declared himself quit of him. Surely, Abraham was earnest in his supplication and tenderhearted.","1350":"Nor will Allah lead a nation astray after He has given them guidance until He has made clear to them all that they should guard against. Allah has knowledge of all things.","1351":"Indeed, to Allah belong the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; He gives life and causes death. Other than Allah, you have neither a guardian nor a helper.","1352":"In the hour of adversity, Allah turned (in mercy) to the Prophet, the Emigrants (of Mecca) and the Supporters (of Madinah) who followed him when some of their hearts were about to swerve away. He turned to them, indeed, He is Gentle, the Most Merciful.","1353":"And to the three who were left behind (at the Battle of Tabuk), until the earth became narrow with all its vastness, and their souls became narrow for them, they knew there was no shelter from Allah except in Him. Then He turned to them (in mercy) so that they might also turn (in repentance). Allah is the Turner, the Most Merciful.","1354":"Believers, fear Allah and stand with the truthful.","1355":"The people of Madinah and the Arabs who dwell around them have no cause to stay behind the Messenger of Allah, or to prefer their lives to his. They are neither stricken by thirst, nor by tiredness, nor yet by hunger in the Way of Allah, nor do they take steps that anger the unbelievers, nor gain any gain from an enemy, but that it is counted as a righteous deed. Allah does not waste the wage of the gooddoers.","1356":"Each sum they spend, be it small or large, and each valley they cross is written to their account, so that Allah may recompense them for their best deeds.","1357":"The believers should not go forth altogether, rather, a party from each section should go forth to become well versed in the religion, and when they return to their people warn them in order that they may beware.","1358":"Believers, fight the unbelievers who are near you. Let them find firmness in you. Know that Allah is with those who are cautious.","1359":"Whenever a chapter is sent down to you, some ask: 'Which of you has it increased in belief' It will surely increase the belief of the believers and they are joyful.","1360":"As for those whose hearts are diseased, they will be increased in filth added to their filth, so that they die as unbelievers.","1361":"Do they not see how once or twice every year they are tried? Yet still they neither repent nor remember.","1362":"Whenever a chapter is sent down, they glance at each other, (asking): 'Does anyone see you' Then they turn away. Allah has turned away their hearts, for they are a nation who do not understand.","1363":"Indeed, there has come to you a Messenger from your own, he grieves for your suffering, and is anxious about you, and is gentle, merciful to the believers.","1364":"Therefore, if they turn away, say: 'Allah is sufficient for me. There is no god except He. In Him I have put my trust. He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne'","1365":"AlifLaamRa. Those are the verses of the Wise Book.","1366":"Is it a wonder to the people that We revealed to a man from among themselves: 'Warn mankind, and bear the glad tidings to those who believe that they stand firm with their Lord' (Yet) the unbelievers say: 'This is a clear sorcerer'","1367":"Indeed, your Lord is Allah, who, in six days created the heavens and the earth and then willed to the Throne, directing affairs. There is no intercessor except by His permission. Such is Allah your Lord, therefore worship Him. Will you not remember?","1368":"To Him all of you will return together. This is, in truth, the promise of Allah. He originates creation, then He revives it so that He may recompense those who believe and do righteous deeds. As for the unbelievers, theirs is a drink of boiling water and a painful punishment for their disbelief.","1369":"It was He that made the sun a brightness and the moon a light, and determined it in phases so that you might know the number of years and the reckoning. Allah did not create them except in truth, and distinguishes the verses to a nation who know.","1370":"In the alternation of the night and day, and in all that Allah has created in the heavens and the earth, surely there are signs for people who are cautious.","1371":"Those who do not expect to meet Us, and are wellpleased with this life and are satisfied with it, and those who are inattentive to Our signs,","1372":"for them, their refuge is the Fire for what they have been earning.","1373":"Indeed, those who believe and do righteous works, their Lord will guide them for their belief, beneath them rivers will flow in gardens of bliss.","1374":"(In it) their supplication will be: 'Exaltations to You, Allah' And their greeting will be: 'Peace' They will end their supplication with 'Praise be to Allah, Lord of the all the Worlds'","1375":"If Allah should hasten evil to people as they would hasten good, their term would already have been decided. But We leave those who do not expect to meet Us to wander blindly in their insolence.","1376":"When affliction befalls a man, he supplicates to Us (lying) on his side, sitting or standing. But as soon as We relieve him from his affliction, he continues (in the same way), as though he never supplicated to Us when harm touched him. So it is, that which the sinners were doing seem fairly decorated to them.","1377":"We destroyed generations before you when they did evil. (When) their Messengers came to them with clear verses they would not believe; so We recompense the sinning nation.","1378":"After them We made you their successors in the earth, so that We might see how you would do.","1379":"When Our verses, clear verses, are recited to them, those who do not reckon to meet Us say: 'Bring a Koran other than this, or make changes in it' Say: 'It is not for me to change it by myself. I follow nothing, except what is sent down to me. Indeed, if I should rebel against my Lord I fear the punishment of a Great Day.'","1380":"Say (Prophet Muhammad): 'Had Allah willed, I would not have recited it to you, nor would He have made it known to you. I lived among you all my life before it (was sent down). Will you not understand?","1381":"Who does greater evil than he who forges a lie about Allah or belies His verses? Indeed, the evildoers do not prosper.","1382":"They worship, other than Allah, that which can neither harm nor benefit them, and say: 'These are our intercessors with Allah' Say: 'Will you tell Allah of something He does not know about either in the heavens or earth? Exaltations to Him! Exalted be He above what they associate'","1383":"(Before) mankind were but one nation, then they differed with one another. But for a Word that preceded from your Lord, it (the matters) over which they differed had already been decided.","1384":"They say: 'Why has no sign been sent down to him from his Lord' Say: 'The Unseen belongs to Allah alone. Wait if you will I am one of those who wait'","1385":"When We let people taste (Our) mercy after they had been afflicted by hardship, they devise against Our verses. Say: 'Allah is more swift in devising' Indeed, Our Messengers (the angels) are writing down whatever you devise.","1386":"It is He who conveys you by land and sea. When you are on board the ship and the ships run with them upon a fair breeze they are joyful. (But when) a strong wind and waves come upon them from every side, and they think they are encompassed, they supplicate to Allah, making their religion His sincerely, (saying): 'If You save us from this, we will indeed be among the thankful'","1387":"But when He has saved them, see how they become wrongfully insolent in the land. People, your insolence is only against yourselves; the enjoyment of this present life, then to Us you shall return and We shall tell you what you did.","1388":"This present life is like the water We send down from the sky. The plants of the earth mix with it and from it mankind and cattle eat; then when the earth has become lush and adorned, its inhabitants think they have power over it, Our command comes upon it by night or day, and We cause it to be stubble, just as though it had not flourished the day before. In this way We distinguish Our verses for those who reflect.","1389":"Allah invites you to the House of Peace. He guides whom He will to a Straight Path","1390":"for those who do good is a fine reward and a surplus. Neither dust nor shame shall cover their faces. Those are the companions of Paradise in it they shall live for ever.","1391":"As for those who have earned evil deeds, evil shall be recompensed with its like. Abasement will cover them, they shall have none to defend them from Allah as though their faces were covered with parts of the blackness of night. Those, they are the companions of the Fire, in it they shall live for ever.","1392":"And on the Day when We assemble them all together, We shall say to those who associated (other gods with Allah): 'Go to your place, you and your associates' Then, We will separate them, and their associates will say (to them): 'It was not us that you worshipped'","1393":"Allah is a Sufficient witness between us and you, surely, we were heedless of your worship.","1394":"There, each soul shall prove its past deeds. They shall be restored to Allah, their Guardian, the True, and that which they forged will escape from them.","1395":"Say: 'Who provides for you from heaven and earth, or who owns the hearing and the sight? Who brings forth the living from the dead, and the dead from the living' Who directs the affair? Surely, they will say: 'Allah' Then say: 'Then, will you not be fearful'","1396":"Such is Allah, your Lord, the True. What, is there after truth, anything except error. Then how are you turned around (from faith)'","1397":"So the Word of your Lord is realized against the evildoers that they do not believe.","1398":"Say: 'Is there any (among) your associates who originates creation, then cause it to be revived yet again' Say: 'Allah, He originates creation, then revives it yet again. How is it that you are so perverted'","1399":"Say: 'Do any of your partners guide you to the truth' Say: 'Allah, He guides to the truth. Who then is worthier to be followed He who guides to the truth or he who cannot guide unless he (himself) is guided? What is the matter with you, how then can you judge'","1400":"Most of them follow nothing except conjecture. But conjecture does not help against the truth. Allah knows the things they do.","1401":"This Koran could not have been forged by other than Allah. It confirms what was before it; a distinguishing Book, in which there is no doubt, from the Lord of all the worlds.","1402":"Do they say: 'He has forged it'. Say: 'Compose one chapter like it, and call upon whom you will, other than Allah (to help you), if what you say is true'","1403":"They have belied that which they did not understand of its knowledge, nor has its interpretation reached them. Those who were before also belied. But see how was the end of the harmdoers.","1404":"Some believe in it, while others do not believe it. Your Lord knows well the corrupters.","1405":"If they belie you, say: 'I have my work, you have your work. You are quit of what I do, and I am quit of what you do'","1406":"Some of them listen to you. But can you make the deaf hear you, even though they cannot understand?","1407":"Some of them look to you. But can you guide the blind, even though they do not see?","1408":"Indeed, Allah does not wrong mankind a thing, but they wrong themselves.","1409":"The Day when He will gather them, (it will be) as though they had lingered but an hour of the Day and they will recognize one another. Lost are those who belied the meeting with their Lord and were not guided.","1410":"Whether We let you see some of that with which We promised them, or We call you to Us, to Us they shall return. Allah is witness of the things they do.","1411":"Every nation has its Messenger. Then, when their Messenger comes the matter is justly decided between them; they are not wronged.","1412":"They ask: 'If what you say is true, when will this promise come'","1413":"Say: 'I have no power to benefit or harm myself except as Allah wills. To every nation is a fixed term and when their term comes they cannot delay it for an hour, nor can they bring it forward.","1414":"Say: 'Have you considered? Should His punishment come upon you by night or by day, what (part) of it would the sinners try to hasten'","1415":"And when it overtakes you, is it then that you will believe in it, now, when you already try to hasten it!","1416":"Then it shall be said to the evildoers: 'Taste the punishment of eternity! Shall you be recompensed except according to what you earned'","1417":"They ask you to tell them if it is true. Say: 'Yes, by my Lord! It is true, and you cannot frustrate it'","1418":"If each soul that has done evil had all that is in the earth, it would offer it for its ransom. And secretly they will feel regret when they see the punishment, and the matter is justly decided between them, and they are not wronged.","1419":"Indeed, to Allah belongs everything in the heavens and the earth. Indeed, the promise of Allah is true though most of them do not have knowledge.","1420":"It is He who gives life and causes death, and to Him you shall be returned.","1421":"People, an admonition has now come to you from your Lord, and a healing for what is in the chests, a guide and a mercy to believers.","1422":"Say: 'In the Bounty of Allah and His Mercy let them rejoice, it (the Koran) is better than that which they hoard'","1423":"Say: 'Have you considered the provision that Allah has sent down for you, and some you have made unlawful and some lawful' Say: 'Has Allah given you His permission, or do you forge (falsehood) against Allah'","1424":"What will those who forged falsehood about Allah think on the Day of Resurrection? Allah is Bountiful to mankind; yet most of them do not give thanks.","1425":"You are not engaged in any matter, neither do you recite any portion of the Koran, nor do you do any work, except that We are witnesses over you when you press upon it? Not even as much as the weight of an ant in earth or heaven escapes your Lord, nor is there anything smaller or greater, but it is (recorded) in a Clear Book.","1426":"Indeed, there shall be neither fear nor sorrow upon the guided by Allah.","1427":"Those who believe and are cautious","1428":"there is for them glad tidings in this present life and in the Everlasting Life. The Word of Allah is unchanging, that is the mighty triumph.","1429":"Do not let their speech grieve you. All might belongs to Allah. He is the Hearing, the Knowing.","1430":"Attention: Indeed to Allah belongs everyone that is in the heavens and in the earth. Those who call upon associates, other than Allah, follow nothing but assumptions, (they are) only lying.","1431":"He it is who has made the night for your rest and the day to see. Surely, in this there are signs for people who listen.","1432":"They say: 'Allah has taken a son' Exaltations be to Him (Allah)! Rich is He. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth you have no authority for this! What, do you say of Allah what you do not know?","1433":"Say: 'Those who forge falsehoods against Allah shall not prosper'","1434":"(They take their) enjoyment in this world, but to Us they shall return, then, We shall let them taste the terrible punishment because they were unbelievers'","1435":"And recite to them the story of Noah. He said to his nation: 'O my nation, if my standing here, reminding you of the verses of Allah grieves you, and in Allah I have put my trust; decide upon your affair with your associates, then do not let your affair worry you. Come to a decision about me, and give me no respite.","1436":"Then, if you turn your backs, I have not asked of you a wage. My wage falls only on Allah. I am commanded to be from those who surrender (Muslims)'","1437":"But they belied him. Therefore We saved him and those who were with him in the Ark, and We made them caliphs, and We drowned those who belied Our verses. See what was the end of those who were warned!","1438":"After him We sent Messengers to their nation. They brought them clear signs, but they were not of those to believe because they had belied it previously. SoWe seal the hearts of the evildoers.","1439":"Then, after them We sent Moses and Aaron with Our signs to Pharaoh and his Council. But they were arrogant, for they were a sinful nation.","1440":"When the truth came to them from Us they said: 'This is indeed clear magic'","1441":"Moses said: 'Is this what you say of the truth when it has come to you? Is this sorcery? Sorcerers do not prosper'","1442":"They said: 'Have you come to turn us away from that which we found our fathers practicing (in order that) the domination of the land might belong to you two? We do not believe you'","1443":"(Then) Pharaoh said: 'Bring every skilled sorcerer'","1444":"When the sorcerers came, Moses said to them: 'Cast down what you will cast'","1445":"And when they had cast, Moses said: 'What you have brought is sorcery. Surely, Allah will render it as nothing. Allah does not put right the work of the corrupt'","1446":"Allah verifies the truth by His Words, even though the sinners hate it.","1447":"So none believed Moses except a few of his nation because they feared that Pharaoh and their Council would persecute them. Pharaoh was mighty in theland, and one of the evildoers.","1448":"Moses said: 'O my nation, if you believe in Allah, put your trust in Him, if you have surrendered (Muslims)'","1449":"They said: 'We have put our trust in Allah. Our Lord, do not let us be a temptation to the harmdoing nation.","1450":"Save us, through Your Mercy, from the unbelieving nation'","1451":"We revealed to Moses and his brother: 'Take certain houses for your people in Egypt. Make your houses a direction (for pray); establish the prayer; and give glad tidings to the believers'","1452":"'Our Lord' supplicated Moses. 'You have given Pharaoh and his Council adornments and possessions in this life. Our Lord, let them go astray from YourPath. Our Lord, destroy their possessions and harden their hearts so that they shall not believe until they see the painful punishment.","1453":"He (Allah) said: 'Your supplication is answered; so go straight and do not follow the way of those who do not know'","1454":"We brought the Children of Israel through the sea, and Pharaoh and his legions pursued them arrogantly and frantically. But as he was drowning he cried out: '(Now) I believe that there is no god except He in whom the Children of Israel believe. I am of those that surrender (Muslims)'","1455":"(Allah said): 'Now (you believe)! But before this you rebelled and were of the corrupt.","1456":"We shall deliver you (Ramsis II) with your body this day, so that you may be a sign to those after you. Indeed many people pay no heed to Our signs!","1457":"(Thereafter) We settled the Children of Israel in a blessed land and provided them with good things. They did not differ until knowledge was given them. Indeed, your Lord will decide between them on the Day of Resurrection.","1458":"If you are in doubt of what We have sent down to you, ask those who recite the Book before you. The truth has come to you from your Lord, therefore do not be of the doubters.","1459":"Do not be among those who belie the verses of Allah, for then you would be among the losers.","1460":"Those against whom the Word of your Lord will be realized will not believe,","1461":"even though every sign comes to them, until they see the painful punishment.","1462":"Why, was there never a village that believed and its belief benefited them? Except Jonah's nation, when they believed, We spared them from a degrading punishment in this life and We gave them enjoyment for awhile.","1463":"Had your Lord willed, whosoever is in the earth, all would have believed. Would you then constrain people until they believe?","1464":"No soul can believe except by the permission of Allah. Upon those who do not understand lays His punishment.","1465":"Say: 'See what is in the heavens and the earth' But neither signs nor warnings help the unbelievers.","1466":"Do they watch and wait for anything except for days similar to those who passed away before them?

This is indeed a strange thing'","1546":"They said: 'What, do you marvel at the command of Allah? The Mercy of Allah and His Blessings be upon you, O people of the House. Indeed, He isPraised, Exalted'","1547":"And when the wonderment departed from Abraham and the glad tidings reached him, he pleaded with Us for the nation of Lot;","1548":"indeed, Abraham was forbearing, tenderhearted and penitent.","1549":"(It was said:) 'Abraham, turn away from this; your Lord's command has indeed come, and there is coming upon them a punishment that will not be turned back'","1550":"And when Our messengers came to Lot, he was troubled and distressed for them, and said: 'This is a harsh day'","1551":"His nation came running towards him; whilst they were doing evil deeds.

Evil is the wateringplace to be led down to!","1572":"A curse was sent to follow them in this world and then upon them on the Day of Resurrection. Evil is the offering to be offered.","1573":"That, which We have related to you, is the news of the villages; some of them still stand, whereas others are stubble.","1574":"We did not wrong them, rather, they wronged themselves. Their gods that they called upon, other than Allah, did not help them when your Lord's command came they did not increased them except in their destruction.","1575":"Such is the seizing of your Lord, when He seizes the evildoing villages. His seizing is painful, stern.","1576":"Indeed, for he who fears the punishment of the Everlasting Life that is a sign. That is a Day on which everyone shall be assembled. That shall be a witnessed Day.","1577":"We shall not postpone it except until a counted term.","1578":"When that Day arrives no soul shall speak except by His permission. Some shall be wretched, and others happy.","1579":"The wretched shall be (cast) in the Fire where they will moan and sigh,","1580":"and there they shall live for ever, as long as the heavens and the earth endure, and as your Lord wills. Indeed, your Lord accomplishes whatsoever He will.","1581":"As for the happy, they shall live in Paradise for ever, so as long as the heavens and the earth endure, and as your Lord wills an unbroken gift.","1582":"Therefore do no be doubtful as to what these worship. They worship only that which their fathers worshiped before them. We shall indeed pay them in full their undiminished measure.","1583":"We gave Moses the Book, but they differed regarding it, but for a word that preceded from your Lord, it had been decided between them; and they are indisquieting doubt of it.","1584":"Indeed, your Lord will pay each one of them in full for their deeds. He is aware of the things they do.","1585":"So you and whosoever repents with you go straight as you have been commanded and do not be insolent, indeed, He sees what you do.","1586":"And do not incline to the wrongdoers lest you are touched by the Fire, for then you shall not be helped. You have no guardians other than Allah.","1587":"And establish your prayer at the two edges of the day and in part of the night. Good deeds will repel evil deeds. That is a remembrance for those whoremember.","1588":"Therefore have patience; Allah will not let the wage of the gooddoers go to waste.","1589":"If (only) there had been except for a few among them whom We saved among the generations that have gone before you, some that remained forbidding corruption in the land, but the wrongdoers pursued the ease they had been given to delight in and became sinners.","1590":"Your Lord would never destroy the villages unjustly, whilst their people were reforming.","1591":"Had your Lord willed, He would have made mankind a single nation.

Your Lord is Knowing, Wise.","1603":"Indeed, in Joseph and his brothers there were signs for those who inquire.","1604":"They said: 'Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than ourselves, even though we are many. Truly, our father is obviously wrong.","1605":"(Let us) kill Joseph, or cast him away in some (far off) land, so that your father's face will be left for you, and afterwards you will be a righteous nation'","1606":"One of them said: 'No, do not kill Joseph, if you do anything, cast him into a dark pit, a traveler will pick him up'","1607":"They said: 'Father, what is the matter with you, do you not trust us with Joseph? Indeed, we are sincere advisors.","1608":"Send him with us tomorrow to frolic and play. We will look after him'","1609":"He said: 'It grieves me to let him go with you, for I fear lest the wolf should devour him when you are not paying attention to him'","1610":"They said: 'We are many, if a wolf devours him, then we are losers'","1611":"When they went with him, they agreed to put him in the bottom of a well. We revealed to him: 'You shall tell them of what they did when they are not aware (it is you)'","1612":"At nightfall, they returned weeping to their father.","1613":"They said: 'We went racing and left Joseph with our things. The wolf devoured him, but you will not believe us, though we speak the truth'","1614":"And they brought his shirt (stained) with blood, a lie. He said: 'No, your souls have tempted you to do something. But come sweet patience! The help ofAllah is always there to seek against that which you describe'","1615":"Thereafter travelers came, and sent their waterman. And when he had let down his pail, (he cried:) 'Rejoice, a boy' Then they concealed him among their merchandise, but Allah knew what they did.","1616":"Then, they sold him for a trifling price, a number of dirhams, because they considered him to be of little value.","1617":"The Egyptian that bought him said to his wife: 'Make his stay honorable. He may benefit us, or take him for our son' As such We established Joseph in the land, so that We might teach him the interpretation of visions. Allah prevails in His affairs, though most people do not know.","1618":"And when he reached maturity, We bestowed on him judgment and knowledge. As such We recompense those who do good.","1619":"And she, in whose house he was, sought to seduce him and closed the doors saying: 'Come' 'In Allah is my refuge' he replied. 'My Lord has made my dwelling a good one. Harmdoers never prosper'","1620":"She desired him, had he not been shown the proof of his Lord he would have taken her. But We turned him away from evil and abomination, for he was one of Our sincere worshipers.","1621":"They raced to the door and she tore his shirt from behind. And by the door, they met her husband whereupon she said: 'What is the recompense of one whose intent is evil against your people other than being imprisoned, or sternly punished'","1622":"He (Joseph) said: 'It was she who sought to seduce me' and a witness (an infant) of her people bore witness, saying: 'If his shirt is torn from the front, she is speaking the truth and he is one of the liars,","1623":"but, if his shirt is torn from behind, she lied, and he is of the truthful'","1624":"And when he saw his shirt torn at the back, he said: 'This is one of your (women's) guiles. Your guile, (O woman), is great indeed!","1625":"Joseph, turn away from this. And you, ask forgiveness for your sin. You are indeed one of the sinners'","1626":"Certain women in the city said: 'The Governor's wife has sought to seduce her servant. He has made her heart stricken with love for him. Clearly, we perceive her to be in error'","1627":"When she heard of their sly whispers, she sent for them and prepared a banquet. To each she gave a knife, (then called Joseph saying:) 'Come and attend to them' When they saw him, they were so taken with him that they cut their hands, and said: 'Allah save us! This is no mortal, he is no other but a noble angel'","1628":"Whereupon she said: 'Now you see, this is he on whose account you blamed me. Yes, I sought to seduce him, but he was unyielding. If he declines to do what I command, he shall be imprisoned and be one of the humiliated'","1629":"He supplicated: 'Lord, prison is dearer to me than that to which they invite me. Yet if You do not shield me from their guile I shall yield to them and be one of the ignorant'","1630":"His Lord answered him and He turned their guile away from him. Indeed, He is the Hearer, the Knower.","1631":"Then it seemed good to them, even after they had seen the signs, that they should imprison him for some time.","1632":"Two young men went to prison with him. One of them said: 'I saw (in a vision) that I was pressing grapes' And the other said: 'I saw (in a vision) that I was carrying bread upon my head, and that birds ate of it.

The matter you inquired about has been decided.","1638":"And he said to the one of the two who he knew would be saved: 'Mention me in the presence of your lord' But satan made him forget to mention him to his master, so that he remained in prison for a certain number years.","1639":"The king said: 'I saw in a vision seven fatted cows being devoured by seven lean ones; and seven green ears of corn and seven others withered. My counselors, tell me the meaning of my vision, if you can interpret visions'","1640":"They said: 'They are confused nightmares, nor do we know anything of the interpretation of visions'","1641":"After all that time, the one of the two who had been saved remembered, he said: 'I will interpret it for you, so let me go'","1642":"(He said:) 'Joseph, the truthful, tell us of the seven fatted cows that were devoured by seven lean ones also of the seven green ears of corn and the other seven which were withered, so that I can go back to the people and then they will then know'","1643":"He replied: 'You shall sow for seven years as is your way. Leave in the ear (of corn) you reap, except a little which you eat.","1644":"Thereafter, seven hard years will come upon you, which will consume all but little of that which you have stored.","1645":"Then, there will come a year in which people are helped, in which the people will press'","1646":"The king said: 'Bring him before me' But when the king's envoy came to him, he said: 'Go back to your lord and ask him: \"What about the women who cut their hands.

'We know no evil against him' The Governor's wife said: 'The truth has been discovered at last; I solicited him; he is among the truthful.","1648":"This (I have done) so that he will know I did not secretly betray him, and that Allah does not guide the guile of the treacherous.","1649":"Yet I do not consider my soul was innocent, surely the soul incites to evil except to whom my Lord has mercy; indeed, my Lord is Forgiving, the MostMerciful'","1650":"The king said: 'Bring him before me. I will assign him to myself' And when he had spoken with him he said: 'Today, you are firmly established in both our favor and trust'","1651":"He (Joseph) said: 'Give me charge of the storehouses of the land, I am a knowledgeable guardian'","1652":"And as such We established Joseph in the land to live wherever he liked. We bestow Our Mercy on whom We will, and We never waste the wage of therighteous.","1653":"Indeed, the reward of the Everlasting Life is better for those who believe and are cautious.","1654":"Joseph's brothers came and presented themselves before him. He recognized them, but they did not know him.","1655":"And when he had given them their provisions, he said: 'Bring me a certain brother from your father. Do you not see that I give just measure and am the bestof hosts?","1656":"If you do not bring him to me, you shall receive no measure (of corn) from me, nor shall you come near me (again)'","1657":"They replied: 'We will ask our father for him. This we will surely do'","1658":"Then he said to his attendants: 'Put their merchandise in their saddlebags, hopefully they will recognize it when they return to their people. Perhaps they will come back'","1659":"When they returned to their father, they said: 'Father, we have been denied the measure. Send our brother with us and we shall receive our measure. We will indeed look after him'","1660":"He replied: 'Am I to trust you with him as I once trusted you with his brother? Why, Allah is the Best of guardians, and He is the Most Merciful of theMerciful'","1661":"When they opened their saddlebags, they found that their merchandise had been given back to them. 'Father' they said 'what more do we desire? Look, our merchandise has been returned to us. We will receive provisions for our family and we will look after our brother. We shall receive an extra camelload, that is an easy measure'","1662":"He replied: 'I will never send him with you until you swear by Allah that you will bring him back to me, unless you are prevented' And when they had given him their oath, he said: 'Allah is the Guardian of what we say'","1663":"Then he said: 'My sons, do not enter from one gate. Enter through different gates. I cannot be of any help to you against Allah; judgement belongs to Allah alone. In Him I have put my trust. In Him let all put their trust'","1664":"And when they entered from where their father had instructed them, nothing helped them against (the decree of) Allah. It was but a need in Jacob's soul which he had fulfilled. He possessed knowledge because of what We had taught him, though most people do not know.","1665":"When they presented themselves before Joseph, he took his brother in his arms, and said: 'I am your brother. Do not grieve at what they did'","1666":"And when he had given them their provisions, he hid a drinkingcup in his brother's saddlebag. Then a herald called out after them: 'Cameleers, you are thieves!'","1667":"They turned back and asked: 'What have you lost'","1668":"'We are missing the goblet of the king' he replied. 'Whosoever restores it shall have a camelload, that I guarantee'","1669":"'By Allah' they said, 'you know we did not come to do evil in this land. We are not thieves'","1670":"They said: 'What shall be the recompense, if you prove to be lying'","1671":"They replied: 'Its recompense in whosoever's saddle bag it is found, he shall be its recompense. As such we punish the harmdoers'","1672":"He searched their bags before his brother's and then took out the goblet from his brother's bag. As such We directed Joseph. By the king's law he had no right to seize his brother unless Allah willed otherwise. We raise whom We will in rank; over every knowledgeable person is One who knows.","1673":"They said: 'If he is a thief know then that a brother of his has committed theft before him' But Joseph kept it secret and did not reveal it to them. He said:'You are in a worse position. And Allah knows well what you describe'","1674":"They said: 'Mighty prince, his father is old, advanced in years, take one of us instead of him. We can see you are amongst the gooddoers'","1675":"He replied: 'Allah forbid that we should seize any but he with whom our property was found, for then we should be harmdoers'","1676":"When they despaired of him, they went in private to confer together. The eldest said: 'Do you not know that your father took a pledge from you in the Name of Allah, and that you failed before regarding Joseph? I shall never stir from this land until my father gives me leave or Allah makes known to me His judgement: He is the Best of judges.","1677":"Return, all of you to your father and say to him: 'Father, your son has committed a theft. We testify only to what we know. How could we guard against the unforeseen?","1678":"Ask the village where we were and the caravan in which we traveled, we speak the truth'","1679":"'No' he (Jacob) said, 'your souls have tempted you to do something. But come sweet patience. Allah may bring them all to me. He alone is the Knowing, the Wise'","1680":"And he turned away and said: 'Alas for Joseph' His eyes turned white with the grief he repressed within him.","1681":"They said: 'By Allah, will you not cease to mention Joseph until you are consumed, or are among the perishing'","1682":"He replied: 'I complain to Allah of my anguish and sadness. I know from Allah what you do not know.","1683":"Go and seek news of Joseph and his brother. Do not despair of the Comfort of Allah, none but unbelievers despair of the Comfort of Allah'","1684":"And when they presented themselves before him they said: 'O mighty prince, we and our people are afflicted with distress. We have brought but little merchandise. Fill up the measure, and be charitable to us; Allah rewards the charitable'","1685":"'Do you know' he replied, 'what you did to Joseph and his brother in your ignorance'","1686":"They said: 'Are you Joseph' 'I am Joseph' he answered, 'and this is my brother. Allah has been gracious to us. Those who keep from evil and are patient, indeed, Allah does not let the wage of the good doers go to waste'","1687":"'By Allah' they said, 'Allah has preferred you above us all. We have indeed been sinful'","1688":"He replied: 'Let no reproach be on you this day. Allah will forgive you He is the Most Merciful of the merciful.","1689":"Go, take this shirt of mine and cast it over my father's face, he will recover his sight. Then return to me with all your family'","1690":"As the caravan departed, their father said: 'I smell the scent of Joseph, unless you think I am foolish'","1691":"'By Allah' they said, 'this is but your old illusion'","1692":"And when the bearer of glad tidings arrived, he laid Joseph's shirt over him, and he saw once again. He said: 'Did I not tell you that I know from Allah what you do not know'","1693":"His sons said: 'Father, ask forgiveness for our sins. We have indeed been sinners'","1694":"He said: 'I shall ask my Lord to forgive you. He is Forgiving, the Most Merciful'","1695":"And when they entered before Joseph, he took his father and mother into his arms and said: 'Welcome to Egypt, safe, if Allah wills'","1696":"He lifted his parents to the throne, and (the others) bowed before him. Joseph said to his father: 'This is the meaning of my vision of long ago, my Lord has verified it. He has been gracious to me. He brought me out of prison and brought you out of the desert after satan had corrupted (the relationship) between me and my brothers. My Lord is Gentle to whom He will. He alone is the Knower, the Wise.","1697":"Lord, You have given me the kingdom and taught me to interpret visions. Originator of the heavens and the earth, my Guardian in this world and in the Everlasting Life. Let me die in submission (as a Muslim) and let me join the righteous'","1698":"That is of the news We reveal to you of the unseen. You were not present when they agreed upon their plan, scheming.","1699":"Even though you are so eager, most people will not believe.","1700":"You shall ask no wage for it. It is nothing except a reminder to all mankind.","1701":"How many signs in the heavens and earth do they pass by and turn away from.","1702":"And most of them do not believe in Allah, but they associate others with Him.","1703":"Do they feel secure that the punishment of Allah will envelop them, or that the Hour will overtake them suddenly when they are unaware?","1704":"Say: 'This is my Path. I call to Allah with sure knowledge, I and my followers. Exaltations be to Allah! I am not among the idolaters'","1705":"We did not send any before you from the inhabitants of the village, but men to whom a revelation was sent. Have they not traveled in the land and seen what was the end of those before them? Better is the dwelling in the Everlasting Life for those who keep from evil. Do you not understand?","1706":"And when at length Our Messengers despaired and reckoned that they would be belied, Our help came down to them, saving whom We pleased. OurMight cannot be withheld from the guilty nation.","1707":"Indeed, in their stories is a lesson for those of understanding. This is no forged tale, rather, it is a confirmation of the previous, a distinguishing of all things, a guidance and a mercy to a nation who believe.","1708":"AlifLaamMeemRa. Those are the verses of the Book. That which is sent down to you (Prophet Muhammad) from your Lord is the truth, yet most people do not believe.","1709":"It is Allah who raised the heavens without pillars that you see. Then He willed to the Throne and subjected the sun and the moon, each pursuing an appointed course. He directs the affair. He makes plain His verses so that you will firmly believe in meeting your Lord.","1710":"It is He who stretched out the earth and placed upon it firm mountains and rivers. And of all fruits, He has put in it two pairs and drew the veil of night over the day. Surely, in these there are signs for a nation who think.","1711":"And in the land, there are adjoining plots, gardens of vines, sown fields and palmtrees in pairs and single that are watered with one water, yet We make some excel others in produce. Surely, in that are signs for a nation who understand.","1712":"If you would wonder, then wondrous is their saying: 'When we are dust, shall we be raised to life again, a new creation' Such are those who disbelieve in their Lord. Their necks shall be fettered. They shall be the inhabitants of the Fire, in it they shall live for ever.","1713":"They bid you to hasten the evil before the good, yet examples have passed away before them. Your Lord is Forgiving to people despite their evildoing; yet your Lord is Stern in retribution.","1714":"The unbelievers say: 'Why has no sign been sent down to him from his Lord' You are only a warner, and there is a guide for every nation.","1715":"Allah knows what every female bears, and what shrinks and swells the womb. And everything with Him has its measure.","1716":"(He is) the Knower of the unseen and the seen, the Great, the Exalted.","1717":"Similar to yourself is he who conceals his saying, and he who proclaims it, he who hides himself in the night, and he who goes forth by day,","1718":"he has attendant angels before him and behind him, who, by the Command of Allah watch over him. Allah does not change what is in a nation unless they change what is in themselves. Whenever Allah wants evil for a nation, none can ward it off. Other than Him, they have no guardian.","1719":"It is He who shows you the lightning, for fear and hope, and Who produces laden clouds.","1720":"The thunder exalts His praise, and so are the angels are in awe of Him. He looses the thunderbolts and smites whosoever He will. Yet they dispute aboutAllah who is Mighty in power.","1721":"To Him is the Call of truth. Those to whom they call, other than Him, give them no answer. They are like he who stretches out his hands to the water andbids it rise to his mouth, it does not reach it! The prayers of the unbelievers goes astray.","1722":"All who dwell in the heavens and earth shall prostrate themselves before Allah, either willingly or unwillingly; as do their shadows in the mornings andevenings.","1723":"Say: 'Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth' Say: 'Allah' Say: 'Why then have you chosen guardians other than Him, even though they have neither the power to benefit nor harm themselves' Say: 'Are the blind and the seeing equal? Are darkness and light equal? Or, have they ascribed to Allah associates who create as He creates so that all creation is alike to them?\" Say: 'Allah is the Creator of everything. He is the One, the Conqueror'","1724":"He sends down water from the sky and the valleys (wadis) flow each in their measure, and the torrent carries a swelling scum; and fire from that which they kindle; desiring ornament or ware, from that rises a scum like it. As such, Allah strikes both the truth and the false. As for the scum it is cast away as jetsam, but, that which profits people remains on the earth. As such Allah strikes the parables.","1725":"For those who answer their Lord is a most fine reward. But for those who do not answer Him if they possessed all that the earth contains, and as much besides, they would offer it for their ransom. Theirs shall be an evil reckoning. Gehenna (Hell) shall be their refuge, an evil cradling!","1726":"Then is he who knows what is sent down to you from your Lord is the truth like he who is blind? Indeed, only those possessed with minds remember","1727":"who fulfill their promise to Allah and do not break their pledge;","1728":"who join together what Allah has bidden to be united; who fear their Lord and dread the evil reckoning.","1729":"Patient men, desiring the Face of their Lord, establish their prayers, and spend of what We have given them in private and in public; and who wardoff evil with good. Theirs shall be the Ultimate Abode.","1730":"They shall enter the Gardens of Eden together with the righteous among their fathers, their wives, and their descendants. From every gate the angels will come to them,","1731":"'Peace be to you, for that you were patient' Best is the Ultimate Abode.","1732":"As for those who break the covenant of Allah after accepting it, who part what He has commanded to be united and worked corruption in the land, a curse shall be laid on them, and they shall have an evil abode.","1733":"Allah gives abundantly and sparingly to whom He will. They rejoice in this present life; but this present life, beside the Everlasting Life, is nothing but a passing enjoyment.","1734":"And those who disbelieve say: 'Why has no sign been sent down to him by his Lord' Say: 'Allah leads astray whom He will, and guides those who repent,","1735":"those who believe, and whose hearts find comfort in the remembrance of Allah. Is it not with the remembrance of Allah that hearts are satisfied.","1736":"For those who believe and do good works is blessedness and blessed resort'","1737":"As such, We have sent you forth to a nation before whom others have passed away in order that you recite to them what We have revealed to you. Yet they disbelieve the Merciful. Say: 'He is my Lord. There is no god except He. In Him I have put my trust, and to Him I turn'","1738":"If only a Koran whereby the mountains were set in motion, or the earth cleaved asunder, or the dead spoken to. No, but to Allah is the affair altogether. Do those who believe know that had Allah willed He could have guided all people? As for those who disbelieve, because of what they do, disaster will not cease to afflict them, or it alights near their home until the promise of Allah comes. Allah will not break His promise.","1739":"Other Messengers were mocked before you but I respited the unbelievers, then I seized them. And how was My retribution!","1740":"What, He who stands over every soul for what it has earned, yet they made partners for Allah. Say: 'Name them. Or would you tell Him of that which is unknown in the earth to Him? Or in outward speech only' Indeed, their devising seems fair to the unbelievers, for they are barred from the Right Way. None can guide those whom Allah leads astray.","1741":"They shall be punished in this life but the punishment of the Everlasting Life is more grievous. None shall defend them from Allah.","1742":"The likeness of Paradise which the righteous have been promised beneath it rivers flow, its produce and shade are eternal. Such is the payment of the righteous. But the payment of the unbelievers is the Fire.","1743":"Those to whom We have given the Book rejoice in what is sent down to you, while some factions reject a part of it. Say: 'I am commanded to worship Allah and to associate none with Him. To Him I supplicate, and to Him I turn'","1744":"And as such We have sent it down an Arabic judgment. And if you follow their desires, after the knowledge that has come to you, you shall have no guardian other than Allah, nor yet a defender.","1745":"We have sent forth other Messengers before you and given them wives and descendants. Yet none of them could bring a sign except by the permission of Allah. Every term has its Book.","1746":"Allah blots out, and He establishes what He will. With Him is the Essence of the Book.","1747":"Whether We show you part of that We promise them, or We call you to Us, it is only for you to deliver the Message, and Ours is the accounting.","1748":"Do they not see how We come to the land and reduce its extremities? Allah judges; none repel His judgement. Swift is His reckoning.","1749":"Those who have gone before them devised, but to Allah is the devising altogether. He knows what every soul earns. The unbelievers shall know without doubt for whom is the Ultimate Abode.","1750":"Those who disbelieve say: 'You are not a Messenger' Say: 'Allah is a Sufficient witness between me and you, and whosoever possess knowledge of the Book'","1751":"AlifLaamRa. We have sent down to you (this Book) in order that you bring mankind from darkness to the light by the permission of your Lord, to the Path of the Almighty, the Praised.","1752":"Allah to whom belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. Woe to the unbelievers for a terrible punishment.","1753":"Those who prefer this life more than the Everlasting Life, and bar others from the way of Allah and seek to make it crooked they are in far error.","1754":"We have sent no Messenger except in the tongue of his own nation, so that he might make everything plain to them. But Allah leads astray whom He will and guides whom He will. He is the Almighty, the Wise.","1755":"We sent Moses with Our signs, 'Bring your nation out of darkness into the light, and remind them of the Days of Allah' Surely, in that are signs for every patient, thankful (person).","1756":"Moses said to his nation: 'Remember the blessing of Allah to you when He saved you from Pharaoh's family, who had oppressed you cruelly, and who slew your sons and spared your women. Surely, that was a great trial from your Lord.","1757":"And when your Lord proclaimed: \"If you give thanks, I will increase you, but, if you are unthankful My punishment is indeed stern.'","1758":"And Moses said: 'If you and all mankind are thankless, He is surely Rich, Praised'","1759":"Have you not heard what befell the nations that have gone before you? The nations of Noah, Aad, and Thamood, and those who came after? None knows them but Allah. Their Messengers came to them with clear signs, but they thrust their hands into their mouths and said: 'Without doubt we disbelieve the Message you have been sent with. That which you call us to is disquieting'","1760":"Their Messengers said: 'Is there any doubt about Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth? He calls you to Him in order that He forgives you your sins and defers you till a stated term' They said: 'You are only mortals like us. You wish to bar us from that which our fathers worshipped. Give us some clear proof.'","1761":"Their Messengers said to them: 'We are nothing except humans like you. But Allah bestows His Mercy on those of His worshipers whom He chooses. We cannot give you proof, except with the permission of Allah. In Allah, let believers put their trust.","1762":"And why should we not put our trust in Allah, when He has already guided us to our Paths? We will endure your hurt patiently. In Allah, let all who trust place their trust'","1763":"Those who disbelieved said to their Messengers: 'Return to our faith or we will banish you from our land' But Allah revealed to them: 'We shall destroy the harmdoers","1764":"and let you live in the land after them. This is for him who fears My station and fears My threat'","1765":"They sought a judgment, then every tyrant was disappointed.","1766":"Gehenna (Hell) is before him and he is given oozing pus to drink,","1767":"which he gulps and can scarcely swallow. Death will come to him from every side, yet he cannot not die, and yet to come is a dreadful punishment.","1768":"As for the likeness of those who disbelieve in their Lord, their works are like ashes which a strong wind scatters on a stormy day; they are powerless over that they have earned; that is the far error.","1769":"Do you not see that Allah has created the heavens and the earth with truth? He can put you away if He will and bring into being a new creation;","1770":"indeed, that is no great thing for Allah.","1771":"Together they shall all come before Allah. Then the weak will say to those who were proud: 'We were your followers. Can you help us in anything against the punishment of Allah' They will say: 'Had Allah guided us we would have guided you. It is now the same for us whether we cannot endure or bear patiently, we have no place of refuge'","1772":"And when the issue has been decided, satan will say (to them): 'The promise which Allah made you was true. I promised you, but failed to keep it. I had no authority over you except that I called you, and you answered me. Do not bame me, rather, blame yourselves. I cannot help you, nor can you help me. I disbelieved in your associating me (with Allah) before' Indeed, for the evildoers there is a painful punishment.","1773":"As for those who believe and do good works, they shall be admitted to gardens underneath which rivers flow in which, by the permission of their Lord, they shall live for ever. Their greeting shall be: 'Peace'","1774":"Have you not seen how Allah sets forth a parable that a good deed is like a good tree, its roots are firm and its branches are in the heaven,","1775":"yielding its fruit every season by the permission of Allah? Allah gives parables to mankind so that they might remember.","1776":"The likeness of a corrupt word is like a corrupt tree uprooted from the earth having no stability.","1777":"Allah will strengthen the believers with a steadfast Word, both in this life and in the Everlasting Life. Allah leads the evildoers astray. Allah does what He will.","1778":"Have you not seen those who exchanged the favor of Allah with disbelief and landed their nation in a house of ruin?","1779":"They shall be roasted in Gehenna; an evil establishment!","1780":"They set up rivals with Allah to lead others astray. Say to them: 'Take your pleasure; your arrival shall be the Fire'","1781":"Tell My worshippers, those who believe, who establish the prayer, and spend of what We have given them in private and in public, before the coming of that Day in which there is neither bargaining, nor the taking of friends,","1782":"it is Allah who created the heavens and the earth, and sends down water from the heaven with which He brings forth fruits for your provision. He has subjected to you ships which, by His command, run upon the sea. He has subjected to you rivers,","1783":"and He subjected to you the sun and the moon, which are constant in their courses. And, He has subjected to you the night and the day, and gave you all that you asked of Him.","1784":"If you count the blessings of Allah, you will never number them. Indeed, the human is wicked and thankless.","1785":"And when Abraham said: 'My Lord, make this a land secure. Turn me and my children away from worshipping idols.","1786":"My Lord they have led many people astray. Whosoever follows me belongs to me. Whosoever rebels against me, You are surely Forgiving, the MostMerciful.","1787":"'Our Lord, I have settled some of my offspring in a barren valley near Your Holy House; our Lord, in order that they establish the prayer. Make the hearts of people yearn towards them, and provide them with fruits, in order that they are thankful.","1788":"Our Lord, You have knowledge of all that we hide and all that we reveal; nothing in heaven or earth is hidden from Allah.","1789":"Praise be to Allah who has given me Ishmael and Isaac in my old age! Indeed, my Lord is the Hearer of the supplication.","1790":"My Lord, make me and my descendants establishers of prayer. Our Lord, accept my prayer.","1791":"Forgive me, our Lord, and forgive my parents and all the believers on the Day of Reckoning'","1792":"Do not think that Allah is unaware of the harmdoers work. He only gives them respite till the Day on which all eyes will stare,","1793":"when they shall run with their necks outstretched and heads erect, their glances never return to themselves, their hearts are empty.","1794":"Warn mankind of the Day when the punishment will overtake them, when the evildoers will say: 'Our Lord, grant us respite for awhile, we will answer Your call, and follow the Messengers' Did you not once swear that you would never cease?","1795":"You lived in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves, and it was clear to you how We dealt with them, and how We struck parables for you.","1796":"They plotted their plots, but their plots are (known) to Allah, even though their plots were such as to move mountains.","1797":"Do not think that Allah will break the promise He gave to His Messengers. Mighty is Allah, and Vengeful.","1798":"On the Day when the earth is changed into other than the earth and the heavens, all shall come before Allah, the One, the Conqueror.","1799":"On that Day, you shall see the sinners coupled together in fetters;","1800":"their garments shall be of melted tar, and their faces enveloped by the Fire.","1801":"Allah will recompense each soul according to its earnings. Swift is the Reckoning of Allah.","1802":"This is a message to be delivered to mankind so that they may be warned by it, and know that He is (Allah) One God, and so all those possessed of minds may remember.","1803":"AlifLaamRa. Those are the verses of the Book, the Clear Koran.","1804":"It could be that those who disbelieve will wish that they were Muslims.","1805":"Let them eat and enjoy; and let their hopes deceive them, soon they shall know.","1806":"We never destroyed a village whose term had not already been decreed.","1807":"No nation can outstrip its term, nor do they put it back.","1808":"They say: 'You to whom the Remembrance is sent down, you are indeed mad.","1809":"Why do you not bring down the angels, if what you say is true'","1810":"We do not send angels except with the truth. Then they shall have no respite.","1811":"It is We who sent down the Koran, and We watch over it.","1812":"We have sent forth before you Messengers among the factions of the ancients.","1813":"But no Messenger came to them except he was mocked.","1814":"So We make it enter the hearts of the sinners.","1815":"They do not believe in it even though the practice of the ancients has already gone.","1816":"If We opened a gate in the heaven and they kept ascending through it,","1817":"still they would say: 'Our eyes were dazzled; truly, we must have been a bewitched people'","1818":"We have set constellations in the heavens and made them pleasing to the beholders,","1819":"and guarded them from every stoned satan.","1820":"Except for he who steals the listening and is then pursued by a visible flame.","1821":"We have spread out the earth and set upon it firm mountains. Everything We have caused to grow therein is justly weighed;","1822":"and there appointed for you is a livelihood, and for those you do not provide.","1823":"And there is not a thing but with Us are its treasuries, and We do not send it down except in a known measure.","1824":"We send the winds fertilizing, and We send down out of heaven water, from which you drink and you are not its treasurers.","1825":"And surely, it is We who give life and make to die.

The Hour is sure to come, therefore, forgive them with a graciouspardon.","1888":"Your Lord is the Creator, the Knower.","1889":"We have given you the seven dual (verses, Al Fatihah) and the Mighty Holy Reading (Koran).","1890":"Do not stretch your eyes to that We have given pairs of them to enjoy, nor sorrow for them, and lower your wing to the believers.","1891":"And say: 'I am the plain warner'","1892":"So We sent it down to the partitioners,","1893":"who have broken the Koran into parts,","1894":"so by your Lord, We will question them all","1895":"about what they did.","1896":"Proclaim then, what you are commanded and turn away from the unbelievers.","1897":"We suffice you against those who mock,","1898":"and those who set up other gods with Allah, indeed, they will soon know.","1899":"Indeed, We know your chest is straitened by that they say.","1900":"Exalt with the praise of your Lord and be one of those who prostrate.","1901":"Worship your Lord till the certainty (death) comes to you.","1902":"The Command of Allah will surely come; do not seek to hasten it.

Your Lord is the Clement, the Most Merciful.","1909":"(He has created for you) horses, mules, and donkeys, which you ride and as an adornment; and He creates what you do not know.","1910":"It is for Allah to show the way. Some swerve from it, but had He willed, He would have guided all of you.","1911":"It is He who sends down water from heaven, which provides drink for you and brings forth trees on which your herds feed.","1912":"And thereby He brings forth crops and olives, palms and vines, and all the fruits. Surely, in this there is a sign for a nation who think.","1913":"He has subjected to you the night, the day, the sun and the moon. The stars are subjected by His Command. Surely, in that there is a sign for a nation who understands.","1914":"And what He has multiplied for you in the earth is of various hues; surely, in that there is a sign for a nation who remember.","1915":"It is He who has subjected the sea to you, so that you eat of its soft flesh and bring up from it ornaments which you wear.

Those who do not believe in the Everlasting Life their hearts disbelieve, and are puffed up with pride.","1924":"Allah knows without doubt what they hide and what they make known. He does not love the proud.","1925":"And if they are asked: 'What has your Lord revealed' they say: 'Tales of the ancients, fairytales'","1926":"They shall carry their sins completely on the Day of Resurrection, and some of the sins of those who were led astray by them without knowledge. Evil is that which they sin.","1927":"Those who have gone before them also plotted. Then, Allah came upon their building from the foundations, and the roof fell down on them from above them.

He will say: 'Where are My partners, for whose sake you opposed' And those to whom knowledge has been given will say: 'Degradation today and evil are on the unbelievers,","1929":"whom the angels take while they were still harming themselves' Then they will offer submission, saying: 'We have done no evil' No, surely Allah knows what you have done.","1930":"Enter the gates of Gehenna (Hell) to be in it for ever. Evil is the lodging of the proud.","1931":"It is said to the cautious: 'What has your Lord revealed' They will reply: 'Good' For those who did good in this world is goodness; indeed the lodging in the Everlasting Life is better an excellent dwelling for the cautious.","1932":"They shall enter the Gardens of Eden, under which rivers flow, and there they shall have all they desire. So Allah recompenses the cautious,","1933":"whom the angels take while they are goodly, saying: 'Peace be on you. Enter Paradise for what you were doing'","1934":"Are they looking for the angels to come down or the order of your Lord to come? As such did those who have gone before them.

Yet what should Messengers do but give a clear deliverance?","1937":"We sent a Messenger to every nation, saying: 'Worship Allah and avoid the idols' Amongst them were some whom Allah guided, and some justly disposed to error. Travel in the land and see what was the end of those who belied (the Revelation and the prophets)!","1938":"Though you are ever so eager to guide them, Allah will not guide those who mislead (others). There shall be none to help them.","1939":"They solemnly swear by Allah that Allah will never raise the dead to life. No, surely the promise of Allah is binding upon Him, though most people do not know.","1940":"This is in order that He may make clear to them that which they differed upon, and in order that those who disbelieve might know that they were indeed lying.","1941":"When We decree a thing, We only say: 'Be' and it is.","1942":"And those who after they have been wronged emigrated for the Cause of Allah, We will lodge them with a good (life) in this world, but greater still is the wage of the Everlasting Life, if they but knew;","1943":"such are those who are patient, and put their trust in their Lord.","1944":"We never sent but men before you to whom We revealed, ask the people of the Remembrance, if you do not know.","1945":"(We sent them) with clear signs and the Psalms. And We sent down to you the Remembrance so that you can make clear to people what has been sent down to them, in order that they reflect.","1946":"Do those who do evil feel secure that Allah will not make the earth to swallow them, or that the punishment will not fall upon them from where they do not know?","1947":"Or, that He will not seize them in their going to and fro, and they will not be able to frustrate Him?","1948":"Or, that He will not seize them, a little at a time and destroy them? Indeed, your Lord is Clement, the Most Merciful.","1949":"Do they not see how every thing Allah created casts its shadow right and left, prostrating itself before Allah in all humility?","1950":"Everything in the heavens and every crawling creature on earth, and the angels prostrate to Allah and they are not proud;","1951":"they fear their Lord from above them and do as they are commanded.","1952":"Allah says: 'Do not take to yourself two gods. He is only One God; so have awe of Me'","1953":"To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. His is the Religion for ever. Would you then fear any but Allah?","1954":"Whatever favor you have is from Allah. Whenever you are afflicted you groan to Him.","1955":"When He removes your affliction then some of you set up associates to their Lord","1956":"that they may show ingratitude for what We gave them. So, take your pleasure, you shall soon know.","1957":"They set aside a share of that which We have provided them for what they did not know. By Allah, you shall be questioned about your forgeries!","1958":"They ascribe daughters to Allah exaltations to Him! But they themselves would have what they desire!","1959":"When good news of the birth of a female is given to any of them, his face grows dark and inwardly he chokes.","1960":"Because of the evil of the good news he hides himself from people, (pondering) whether he will keep her and be humiliated, or trample her into the dust. Evil is their judgement!","1961":"Those who do not believe in the Everlasting Life, theirs is the evil likeness; and for Allah is the highest likeness. He is the Mighty, the Wise.","1962":"If Allah punished people for their sins, He would not leave one creature that crawls on the earth. He reprieves them to an appointed term; when their term is come, they shall neither delay it by a single hour nor can they hasten it.","1963":"They ascribe to Allah what they themselves dislike. Their tongues utter falsehoods (when they say) the finest of wages shall be theirs. Without doubt, the Fire shall be theirs and they will be hastened to it.","1964":"Indeed, by Allah, We have sent Messengers before you to other nations. But satan made their deeds seem fair to them so that today he is their guardian, and a painful punishment awaits them.","1965":"We have not revealed to you (Prophet Muhammad) the Book except that you may clarify for them that upon which they differ, and as guidance and mercy to a nation who believe.","1966":"Allah sends down water from the sky with which He revives the earth after its death. Surely, in this there is a sign for people who listen.","1967":"Indeed, in the cattle there is a lesson for you. We give you to drink of that which is in their bellies, between the filth (bowels) and blood, pure milk, which is sweet to those who drink.","1968":"And the fruits of the palm and of the vine, from which you derive intoxicants and wholesome provisions. Surely, in this there is a sign for nation who understand.","1969":"Your Lord revealed to the bee: 'Build your homes in the mountains, in the trees, and in what they are building.","1970":"Eat every kind of fruit, and follow the easy ways of your Lord' From its belly comes forth a drink (honey) of many hues in which there is healing for people. Surely, in this there is a sign for a nation who reflect.","1971":"Allah created you, and causes you to die. There are some of you who, after knowing something, will be kept back to the vilest state of life, knowing nothing. Allah is the Knowing, Powerful.","1972":"In your provisions Allah has preferred some of you above others. But, those who have been preferred do not give their provisions to those whom their right hand possess so that they might be equal therein. What, do they vainly disbelieve the favor of Allah?","1973":"Allah has given you wives from among yourselves, and has given you and your wives, sons and grandsons and He has provided you with good things. What, do they believe in vanity; do they disbelieve in the favor of Allah?","1974":"Do they worship, other than Allah, that which has no power to provide them with anything either from the heavens or earth, and can do nothing!","1975":"Therefore, do not strike parables for Allah; Allah knows, but you do not!","1976":"Allah strikes a parable. A servant owned by his master, having no power over anything, and one to whom We have given from Us a fine provision who spends it secretly and openly, are they equal? Praise be to Allah! No, most of them do not know!","1977":"And Allah strikes a parable. Two men, one is dumb and powerless, a burden to his master wherever he sends him he returns with no good. Is he equal with one who orders justice and follows the Straight Path?","1978":"To Allah belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth. The matter of the Final Hour shall be like the twinkling of an eye, or even less. Allah has power over all things.","1979":"Allah brought you out of your mothers' wombs, and gave you hearing, sight and hearts, in order that you be thankful.","1980":"Have they not seen the birds that are subjected in the air of the heaven? Nothing holds them except Allah. Surely, in this are signs for those who believe.","1981":"And it is Allah who has given you houses in which to rest, and from the hides of cattle homes so they are light for you on the day you travel and on the day of settling; while from their wool, fur, and hair (He has given you) furnishing and enjoyment for a while.","1982":"From the things He created, Allah has given you a covering shade, and He has made for you refuges in the mountains. He has given you garments to protect you from the heat, and garments to protect you from your own violence. As such it is that He perfects His favors upon you, in order that you submit.","1983":"But, if they turn away, your mission is only to give plain warning.","1984":"They recognize the favors of Allah, then they disbelieve them; most of them are unbelievers.","1985":"On the Day We shall raise up from every nation a witness, then permission will not be given to the unbelievers, nor shall they be allowed to make restitution.","1986":"And when the harmdoers see their punishment, it shall never be lightened, nor shall they ever be respited.","1987":"And when the idolaters see their associates they will say: 'Our Lord, these are our associates on whom we called other than You' But they will throw back at them saying: 'Surely, you are truly liars'","1988":"On that Day they shall offer to submit to Allah, and what they forged will forsake them.","1989":"Those who disbelieve and bar others from the Path of Allah, We shall add punishment upon their punishment because they were corrupting.","1990":"And on that Day We shall raise up from every nation a witness from their own against them, and We shall bring you (Prophet Muhammad) as a witness against those. And We have sent down to you the Book making everything clear, as a guidance, and mercy, and glad tidings to those who submit.","1991":"Allah orders justice, and good deeds, and giving to one's kindred. He forbids indecency, dishonor and insolence. He admonishes you in order that you take heed.","1992":"Fulfill the covenant of Allah, when you make a covenant and do not break your oaths after they have been confirmed (by swearing in His Name) for you make Allah your surety. Allah has knowledge of what you do.","1993":"Do not be like the woman who breaks her thread, after it is firmly spun into fibers, by taking your oaths as mere mutual deceit, one nation being more numerous than the other. Allah tries you with it. On the Day of Resurrection, He will clarify to you everything on which you were at variance.","1994":"Had Allah willed, He would have made you one nation. But He leads astray whomsoever He will and gives guidance to whomsoever He will. You shall be questioned about what you did.","1995":"Do not take oaths to deceive each other, lest your foot should slip after its firmness, lest you should taste evil, for you barred others from the Path of Allah, and lest a mighty punishment awaits you.","1996":"Do not sell the covenant of Allah for a trifling price. What is with Allah is better for you if you but knew.","1997":"That which you have is transitory, but that which is with Allah endures. We shall reward the patient according to the best of their deeds,","1998":"For whosoever does a righteous deed, be they believing men or women, We shall recompense them with their wage according to the best of their deeds.","1999":"When you recite the Koran, seek refuge in Allah from the stoned satan:","2000":"he has no authority over the believers who put their trust in their Lord.","2001":"He has authority over those who are guided by him, and those who ascribe associates to Him (Allah).","2002":"When We exchange a verse for another and Allah knows best what He is sending down they say: 'You are but a forger' No, most of them do not know.","2003":"Say: 'The Holy Spirit (Gabriel) brought it down from your Lord in truth to confirm those who believe, and to give guidance and glad tidings to those who surrender'","2004":"We know very well that they say: 'A mortal teaches him' The tongue of him at whom they hint is a nonArab; and this is a clear Arabic tongue.","2005":"Those who disbelieve in the verses of Allah, Allah does not guide them for them is a painful punishment.","2006":"None forge lies except those who disbelieve the verses of Allah those, they are the liars.","2007":"Whosoever disbelieves in Allah after believing except he who is forced while his heart remains in his belief but he who opens his chest for disbelief, shall receive the Anger of Allah and for such awaits a mighty punishment.","2008":"That is because they loved this present life above the Everlasting Life. Allah does not guide the unbelievers.","2009":"They are those whose hearts, hearing and sight are sealed by Allah; they are the heedless.","2010":"In the Everlasting Life, they shall assuredly be the losers.","2011":"Then indeed your Lord? to those who emigrated, after they were persecuted, and then strove and were patient, surely, your Lord is thereafter Forgiving, the Most Merciful.","2012":"On the Day when every soul will come pleading for itself and when every soul will be recompensed in full for what it did they shall not be wronged.","2013":"Allah strikes a parable of the village which was safe and peaceful. Its provisions came in abundance from everywhere; but it was thankless for the favors of Allah. Therefore, for what they were doing, Allah let it taste the garment of hunger and fear.","2014":"A Messenger from their own was sent to them, but they belied him. So while they were harmdoers they were seized by the punishment.","2015":"Eat of the lawful and good things with which Allah has provided you and be thankful for the favors of Allah if it is He you worship.","2016":"These things alone He has forbidden to you: what is already dead, blood, the flesh of swine, what has been offeredup to other than Allah. But to whoever is forced to eat any of these, neither desiring nor wanting to transgress, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.","2017":"And do not say what your tongues falsely describe 'This is lawful, and that is forbidden' in order to forge a lie about Allah. Indeed, those who forge a lie about Allah shall never prosper.","2018":"Brief (is their) enjoyment, after which a painful punishment awaits them.","2019":"We have forbidden the Jews what We have already related to you. We did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves.","2020":"Surely, your Lord to those who commit evil through ignorance and afterwards repent, and mend their ways your Lord thereafter is surely Forgiving, Merciful.","2021":"Abraham was (equal to) a nation, obedient to Allah, of pure faith and was not among the idolaters,","2022":"ever thankful for His favors. He chose him and He guided him to a Straight Path.","2023":"We gave goodness to him in this world, and in the Everlasting Life he shall be amongst the righteous.","2024":"Then, We revealed to you: 'Follow the Creed of Abraham, he of pure faith, he was not among the idolaters'","2025":"The Sabbath was ordained only for those who differed about it. On the Day of Resurrection, your Lord will decide the differences that were between them.","2026":"Call to the Path of your Lord with wisdom and fine admonition. Dispute with them in the best manner. Your Lord is well aware of those who have gone astray from His Path and He is well aware of those who are guided.","2027":"If you punish, let your punishment be proportionate to the punishment you received. But if you are patient, it is better for the patient.","2028":"Be patient; yet your patience is only by the help of Allah. Do not grieve for them (the unbelievers), nor distress yourself because of their devising.","2029":"Allah is with the cautious and those who do good.","2030":"Exalted is He who carried His worshiper (Prophet Muhammad) to travel in the night from the Sacred Mosque to the Furthest Mosque which We have blessed around it so that We might show him some of Our signs. He is the Hearer, the Seer.","2031":"We gave Moses the Book and made it a guide for the Children of Israel. 'Take no guardian other than Me.","2032":"(You are) the descendants of those whom We carried (in the Ark) with Noah. He was a truly thankful worshiper'","2033":"And We decreed for the Children of Israel in the Book: 'You shall corrupt the land twice, and you shall ascend exceedingly high'","2034":"And when the promise of the first came, We sent against you Our worshipers, those of great might, and they went through the habitations, and the promise was accomplished.","2035":"Then, We gave the turn back to you to prevail over them, and We helped you with wealth and children, and made you the greater host.","2036":"(We said): 'If you do good, it shall be for your own souls; but if you do evil it is likewise' And when the second promise came (We sent them against you), to sadden your faces and to enter the Mosque as they entered it the first time, they utterly destroyed whatever they came across.","2037":"Perhaps Allah will have mercy on you. But if you return, We will return. We have made Gehenna (Hell) a prison for the unbelievers.","2038":"This Koran guides to the straightest way. It gives glad tidings of a great wage to the believers who do good deeds,","2039":"and for those who do not believe in the Everlasting Life We have prepared for them a painful punishment.","2040":"Yet the human prays for evil as he prays for good mankind is always hasty.","2041":"We appointed the night and the day as two signs. Then, We blotted out the sign of the night and made the sign of the day to see, so that you seek the bounty of your Lord and that you know the number of years and the reckoning. And We have clearly distinguished everything.","2042":"And to every human? We have fastened to him his bird of deeds upon his neck; and on the Day of Resurrection We shall bring forth to him a book spread open wide.","2043":"'Read your book. Your self suffices you this Day as a reckoner against you'","2044":"Whosoever is guided is only guided for his own self, and whosoever goes astray it is only against it. No soul shall bear another's burden. Nor do We punish until we have sent a Messenger.","2045":"When We desire to annihilate a village, We command those who live in ease, but they commit evil therein, then the Word is realized against it and it is utterly annihilated.","2046":"How many generations have We destroyed since Noah! Your Lord suffices as One who is Aware of and sees the sins of His worshipers.","2047":"For whosoever desires this fleeting life We hasten for him whatever We will and to whom We want. Then, We have prepared Gehenna for him where he will be roasted, condemned and rejected.","2048":"Whosoever, being a believer, desires the Everlasting Life and strives for it as he should those their striving will be thanked.","2049":"We help these and those, a gift from your Lord; and your Lord's gift is not restricted.","2050":"See how We have preferred some above others. Yet the Everlasting Life is greater in rank and greater in preferment.","2051":"Do not set up with Allah another god, or you will sit condemned and forsaken.","2052":"Your Lord has ordered you to worship none except Him, and to be good to your parents. If either or both of them attain old age with you, do not say: \"Fieon you\", nor rebuke them, but speak to them with words of respect.","2053":"And lower to them the wing of humbleness out of mercy and say: 'My Lord, be merciful to them, as they raised me since I was little'","2054":"Your Lord knows very well what is in your hearts. If you are good, He is forgiving to those who are penitent.","2055":"Give to the near of kin, the needy and the destitute traveler their rights and do not squander,","2056":"for the wasteful are the brothers of satan; and satan is ungrateful to his Lord.","2057":"But if you turn away from them to seek the Mercy of your Lord, hoping to attain it, then speak to them with gentle words.","2058":"And do not keep your hand chained to your neck (when spending), nor open it completely, so that you will sit blamed and destitute.","2059":"Your Lord gives to whom He will His provisions both abundantly and sparingly. He is aware and sees His worshipers.","2060":"Do not kill your children because you fear poverty. We will provide for you and them. Killing them is a great sin.","2061":"Do not draw near to fornication, for it is an indecency, and its way is evil.","2062":"Do not kill the soul whom Allah has forbidden except by right.

Surely, the promise will be questioned.","2064":"Give full measure when you measure, and weigh with even scales. That is better, and fairer in the end.","2065":"Do not follow what you do not know. The hearing, sight and heart about all these you shall be questioned.","2066":"Do not walk proudly in the earth. Indeed, you will never tear open the earth, nor attain the height of mountains.","2067":"The wickedness of all this is hateful with your Lord.","2068":"That is of the wisdom your Lord has revealed to you. Do not set up with Allah another god, or you will be cast into Gehenna, condemned and rejected.","2069":"What! Has your Lord favored you with sons and taken to Himself females from among the angels? Indeed, you utter a monstrous thing!","2070":"In this Koran We have clarified so that they may remember; but it has only increased their aversion.","2071":"Say: 'If there had been other gods with Him, as they say, they would surely have sought a way to the Lord of the Throne'","2072":"Exaltations be to Him! High indeed be He exalted above what they say!","2073":"The seven heavens, the earth, and whosoever in them, exalt Him. There is nothing that does not exalt with His praise, but you do not understand their exaltation. Surely, He is Clement, Forgiving.","2074":"When you recite the Koran, We place between you and those who do not believe in the Everlasting Life an obstructing barrier.","2075":"We lay veils upon their hearts and heaviness in their ears, lest they understand it. When you (Prophet Muhammad) mention your Lord alone in the Koran, they turn their backs in aversion.","2076":"When they listen to you, We know very well how they listen. When they conspire, when the evildoers declare: 'You are only following a man who is bewitched'","2077":"See what they compared you to. They have surely gone astray and cannot find a Path.","2078":"'What' they say. 'When we are (turned to) bones and broken bits, shall we be raised again in a new creation'","2079":"Say: 'Let you be stones or iron,","2080":"or any other creation yet more monstrous in your minds' They will ask: 'Who will restore us' Say: 'He who originated you at first' They will shake theirheads and ask: 'When will this be' Say: 'Maybe it is near,","2081":"on that Day, He will summon you, and you shall answer Him with praise and you shall think you have stayed but for a little'","2082":"Tell My worshipers, that they should say words that are the finest, satan would arouse discord among them; he is the clear enemy of mankind.","2083":"Your Lord knows you very well. He will have mercy on you if He will, or punish you if He will. We have not sent you to be their guardian.","2084":"Your Lord knows very well all who are in the heavens and the earth. We have preferred some Prophets above others, and to David We gave the Psalms.","2085":"Say: 'Call to those whom you assert, other than Him. They have neither the power to remove your affliction nor to transfer it'","2086":"Those, they call upon are themselves seeking a means to come to their Lord, competing with each other to be nearer; they hope for His Mercy and fear His punishment. Indeed, the punishment of your Lord is the subject of caution.","2087":"There is no village except that it shall be destroyed or that We will punish it with a stern punishment before the Day of Resurrection. That is inscribed in theBook.","2088":"Nothing prevented Us from sending the signs but that the ancients belied them. To Thamood, We brought the shecamel as a visible (sign), yet they wronged her. We do not send signs except to frighten.","2089":"When We said to you: 'Indeed, your Lord encompasses all people' We did not make the vision which We showed to you, and the tree cursed in the Koran except to be a trial for people, and We frighten them, but it only increases them in great insolence.","2090":"When We said to the angels: 'Prostrate yourselves before Adam' they all prostrated themselves, except iblis (father of the jinn), who said: 'Shall I prostrate to him whom You have created from clay?","2091":"What do You think' he said: 'This whom You have honored above me, if You defer me until the Day of Resurrection, I will root out all but a few of his seed (by misleading them)'","2092":"'Begone' said He. 'Indeed, Gehenna is your recompense, and the reward of those who follow you, an ample recompense.","2093":"Rouse with your voice whoever you are able from among them. Rally against them your cavalry and those on foot. Share their wealth and children with them, and promise them' But satan promises them nothing except delusion.","2094":"'Over My worshipers you shall have no authority' Your Lord is their Sufficing Guardian.","2095":"It is your Lord who drives your ships at sea so that you may seek His bounty. He is indeed the Most Merciful towards you.","2096":"When misfortune befalls you at sea, all except He of those to whom you supplicate forsake you; yet when He delivers you safely to the land, you turn away. The human is unthankful.","2097":"Do you feel secure that He will not cause the shore to swallow you, or let loose a squall of pebbles upon you? Then you shall find no guardian for yourself.","2098":"Or, do you feel secure that He will not send you back into it a second time, and send against you a violent tempest and drown you because of disbelief? Then you shall find no prosecutor (to help) you against Us.","2099":"We have honored the children of Adam and carried them on both land and sea. We have provided them with good things and greatly preferred them above much of Our creation.","2100":"On the Day when We call all the people with their record, whosoever is given his book in his right hand shall read their book, and they shall not be wronged by as much as a single datefiber.","2101":"But he who is blind in this life, shall be blind in the Everlasting Life and will be further astray from the Path.","2102":"Indeed, they were near to seducing you from that We revealed to you, so that you might forge against Us another, and then they would surely have taken you as a friend;","2103":"and if We had not fortified you, you would have been very slightly inclining towards them;","2104":"then We would have let you taste the double of life and death; and you would have found none to help you against Us.","2105":"They very nearly provoked you to drive you out of the land, but they would have only lingered for a little while after you.","2106":"Such was Our way with those whom We sent before you. You shall find no change in Our way.","2107":"Establish the prayer at the decline of the sun till the darkening of the night and the Koran recital at dawn. Surely, the Koran recital at dawn is witnessed.","2108":"As for the night there is a voluntary deed for you to keep vigil in part it. Perhaps your Lord will raise you to a praiseworthy station.","2109":"Say: 'Lord, grant me an entrance of sincerity and an exit of sincerity, and give me from Yours a victorious power'","2110":"Say: 'Truth has come and falsehood has vanished. Indeed, falsehood will certainly vanish'","2111":"We sent down of the Koran that which is a healing and a mercy to believers, but to the harmdoers it does not increase them, except in loss.","2112":"Yet when We bestow favors upon mankind he turns his back and withdraws to one side. But when evil befalls him, he despairs.","2113":"Say: 'Each human works in his own manner. But your Lord knows very well who is best guided on the way'","2114":"They question you about the spirit. Say: 'The spirit is from the command of my Lord. Except for a little knowledge you have been given nothing'","2115":"If We pleased We could take away that which We have revealed to you then you should find none to guard you against Us,","2116":"except for Mercy from your Lord; for His favor to you is great indeed.","2117":"Say: 'If mankind and jinn combined together to produce the like of this Koran, they would never be able to produce one like it, not even if they were to help one another'","2118":"Indeed, We have set forth for mankind in this Koran every kind of parable, yet most people refuse all except disbelief.","2119":"They say: 'We will not believe in you until you make a spring gush from the earth for us,","2120":"or, until you own a garden of palms and vines and cause rivers to gush forth with abundant water in them;","2121":"or, until you cause the sky to fall upon us in pieces, as you have claimed, or, as a surety bring Allah with the angels in front;","2122":"or, until you possess an ornate house of gold, or ascend into the heavens; and we will not believe in your ascension until you have brought down for us a book which we can read' Say: 'Exaltations to my Lord! Am I anything except a human Messenger'","2123":"Nothing prevented people from believing when guidance came to them but (the excuse): 'Has Allah sent a human as a Messenger'","2124":"Say: 'Had there been angels walking at peace in the earth, We would have sent down an angel from heaven to them as a Messenger'","2125":"Say: 'Allah is sufficient as a witness between me and you. He knows and observes His worshipers'","2126":"Those whom Allah guides are rightly guided; but for those whom He leads astray you shall find no guardian, other than Him. On the Day of Resurrection We shall gather all of them upon their faces, blind, dumb, deaf. Gehenna shall be their refuge, whenever it dwindles, We will increase the Blaze for them.","2127":"That will be their recompense because they disbelieved Our verses and said: 'When we are turned to bones and broken bits, shall we really be raised up once more as a new creation'","2128":"Have they not seen that Allah, who has created the heavens and the earth, has power to create their like? There is no doubt that He has appointed for them aterm, yet the unbelievers refuse all but disbelief.","2129":"Say: 'If you possessed the treasuries of my Lord's Mercy, you would hold them back for fear of spending and mankind is ever grudging!","2130":"To Moses We gave nine clear signs. Ask the Children of Israel about how he came to them. When Pharaoh said to him: 'Moses, I think you are bewitched.'","2131":"'You know' he replied, 'that none except the Lord of the heavens and the earth has sent down these as clear proofs. Pharaoh, I believe you are destroyed.'","2132":"Pharaoh sought to provoke them so that they would leave the land, but We drowned him, together with all who were with him.","2133":"And thereafter We said to the Children of Israel: 'Dwell in the land. When the promise of the Everlasting Life comes We shall bring you all together'","2134":"We have sent it down with the truth, and with the truth it has come down. We have not sent you except a bearer of glad tidings and a warner,","2135":"and We have divided the Koran for you to recite at intervals to mankind and We have sent it down successively.","2136":"Say: 'Believe in it, or do not believe. When it is recited to those to whom knowledge was given before they fall prostrate upon their faces","2137":"and say, \"Exaltations be to our Lord! The promise of our Lord is done.'","2138":"They fall down upon their chin, weeping and it increases them in humility.","2139":"Say: 'Call upon Allah, or call upon the Merciful; whichever (Name) you call upon, to Him belong the Most Beautiful Names' Pray neither loudly nor to quietly, rather, seek a middle course between them.","2140":"Say: 'Praise be to Allah who has not taken a son; who has no associate in the Kingdom; nor out of humility any guardian' And exalt Him repeatedly with exaltations.","2141":"Praise belongs to Allah who has sent down the Book to His worshiper (Prophet Muhammad) and has not made any crookedness in it,","2142":"unswerving. To warn of great violence from Him, and to give good tidings to the believers who do good deeds that theirs shall be a goodly wage","2143":"and they will live for ever therein.","2144":"And it (the Koran) warns those who say: 'Allah has taken a son'","2145":". Surely, of this they have no knowledge, neither they nor their fathers; it is a monstrous word that comes from their mouths, they say nothing but a lie.","2146":"Yet perchance, if they do not believe in this tiding, you will consume yourself with grief and follow after them.","2147":"We have appointed all that is on the earth an adornment for it, in order that We try which of them is finest in works.","2148":"We will surely reduce all that is on it to barren dust.","2149":"Or, do you think the companions of the Cave and the tomb stone were a wonder among Our signs?","2150":"When the youths sought refuge in the Cave, they said: 'Lord give us from Your Mercy and furnish us with rectitude in our affair'","2151":"For many years We sealed up their hearing in the Cave,","2152":"and thereafter We revived them to find out which of the two parties could best calculate the length of their stay.","2153":"In truth We tell to you their news. They were young men who believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance.","2154":"We strengthened their hearts when they stood up and said: 'Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We will call on no other god except Him; (for if we did), we would have spoken outrageously (in disbelief),","2155":"These, our nation have taken to themselves gods, other than Allah. Why do they not bring some clear authority regarding them! Who does greater evil than he who forges a lie against Allah'","2156":"When you depart from them and from what they worship, other than Allah, seek refuge in the Cave. Allah will extend His Mercy to you and will furnish you with a gentle issue of your affair.","2157":"You might have seen the rising sun incline towards the right of their Cave, and, as it set go past them on the left, while they stayed within an open space in the Cave. That was one of the signs of Allah. He whom Allah guides is rightly guided; but he whom He leads astray you shall not find for him a guardian to guide him.","2158":"You might have thought them awake, though they were sleeping. We turned them about to the right and to the left, while their dog stretched its paws at the entrance. Had you seen them you would surely have become filled with terror and turned your back on them in flight.","2159":"As such We revived them so that they might question one another. 'How long have you stayed here' asked one of them. 'We have been here a day, or part of it' they replied. They said: 'Your Lord knows best how long we have stayed here. Let one of you go to the city with this silver (coin) and let him search for one who has the purest food and bring provision from it. Let him be courteous, but let no one sense it is you.","2160":"For, if they appear in front of you, they will stone you to death or restore you to their religion. Then you will never prosper'","2161":"And so We made them (the unbelievers) stumble upon them, so that they might know that the promise of Allah is true and that there is no doubt about theHour. They argued among themselves over their affair, then (the unbelievers) said: 'Build a building over them (their remains). Their Lord knows best who they were. 'But those who prevailed over the matter said; 'We will build around them a Mosque'","2162":"Some will say: 'They were three; their dog was the fourth' Others, guessing at the Unseen, will say: 'They were five and their dog was the sixth' And yet others: 'Seven; their dog was the eighth' Say: 'My Lord knows best their number. Except for a few none know their number' Therefore, do not dispute with them except in outward disputation, and do not ask any of them concerning them.","2163":"Do not say of anything: 'I will do it tomorrow'","2164":"unless (you add) 'if Allah wills' And remember your Lord when you forget and say: 'It may be that my Lord will guide me to something nearer to rectitude than this'","2165":"And they stayed in the Cave three hundred years and to that they added nine more.","2166":"Say: 'None but Allah knows how long they stayed. To Him belong the Unseen in the heavens and the earth. How well He sees, and how well He hears! They have no other guardian, other than Him, and He allows no one (to share) His rule'","2167":"Recite what is revealed to you in the Book of your Lord. No one can change His Words. You shall find no refuge other than Him.","2168":"And be patient with those who call to their Lord in the morning and evening, desiring His Face. And do not turn your eyes away from them desiring the good things of this life, nor obey he whose heart We have made neglectful of Our remembrance; so that he follows his own lust, and his affair has become excessive.","2169":"Say: 'This is the truth from your Lord. Let whosoever will, believe, and whosoever will, disbelieve it' For the harmdoers, We have prepared a Fire, the pavilion of which encompasses them. When they cry out for relief, they shall be showered with water as hot as molten copper, which will scald their faces; how evil a drink, and how evil a restingplace!","2170":"As for those who believe and do good works We do not waste the wage of whosoever does good works.","2171":"Those, they shall live in the Gardens of Eden, underneath which rivers flow. They shall be adorned with bracelets of gold and arrayed in green garments of silk, and brocade, reclining therein on couches; how excellent is their reward and how fine is their resting place!","2172":"Give them the parable of two men. To one we gave two gardens of vines and surrounded them with palm trees and in between the two we placed a sownfield.","2173":"Each of the two gardens yielded its produce and did not fail in the least and We made a river to gush through them,","2174":"so he had fruit. As he spoke with his companion, as he was conversing with him, 'My wealth is more abundant than yours and men have a greater respect for me'","2175":"And when, having wronged himself, he entered his garden, he said: 'I do not think that this will ever perish!","2176":"Nor do I think that the Hour will come. Even if I returned to my Lord, I should surely find a better place than this'","2177":"His companion said, during his conversation with him: 'What, do you disbelieve in Him who created you from dust, then from a spermdrop, and then fashioned you into a man!","2178":"He is Allah, my Lord, and I will not associate anyone with My Lord.","2179":"When you entered your garden why did you not say: \"If Allah wills; there is no power except by Allah.\" Though you see me lesser than yourself in wealth and children,","2180":"maybe my Lord will give me a garden better than yours, and send down a thunderbolt from heaven, so that in the morning it will be a slope of dust,","2181":"or, in the morning its water will be drained into the earth so that you will not have a means to reach it'","2182":"And all his fruit were destroyed, and in the morning he wrung his hands with grief at all he had spent on it, for it had collapsed upon its trellises, and he said: 'Would that I had not associated anyone with my Lord'","2183":"He had no host to help him besides Allah, and he was helpless","2184":"that Day. Supremacy belongs only to Allah, the True. He is the best to reward and the best ending.","2185":"Give to them a parable about this present life. It is like water We have sent down from the sky with which the plants of the earth mingle, and in the morning it is straw the wind scatters. Allah is Powerful over all things.","2186":"Wealth and children are the ornament of this present life. But the things that last and good deeds, are better with your Lord in reward and hope.","2187":"And on the Day when We shall set the mountains in motion and you shall see the earth a leveled plain; when We gather them together, and would not leave even one behind,","2188":"and they shall be presented in ranks before your Lord (who will say to them:) 'You have returned to Us as We created you the first time. No, you claimed We would not appoint a meeting for you!","2189":"And the Book shall be set in place, and you will see the sinners fearful of what is in it' They shall say: 'Woe to us! How is it, this book omits nothing small or great, all are counted' And they shall find what they did is present, and Your Lord will wrong no one.","2190":"When We said to the angels: 'Prostrate yourselves before Adam' all prostrated themselves except iblis, who was one of the jinn, disobedient to the command of his Lord. Would you then take him and his descendants to be your guardians, other than Me, when they are your clear enemy? How evil is the exchange for the harmdoers!","2191":"Neither did I make them witnesses at the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor at their own creation. I would never take those who lead others astray to be My supporters.","2192":"And the Day He will say: 'Call on those whom you claimed to be My associates' They will invoke them, but they will receive no answer, for We shall place a gulf between them.","2193":"And when the evildoers see the Fire of Hell they will reckon it is there they shall fall. They shall find no escape from it.","2194":"We have set forth for people in this Koran all manner of parables; the human is the most disputatious of things.","2195":"Nothing prevented people from believing and seeking the forgiveness of their Lord when guidance came to them, unless they are waiting for the fate of the ancients to overtake them, or that the punishment should come upon them face to face.","2196":"We send Our Messengers only to proclaim glad tidings and to give warning. But the unbelievers dispute with false arguments so that they may belie the truth. They have taken My verses and warnings in mockery.","2197":"Who is greater in evil than he who, when reminded of the verses of his Lord, turns away from them and forgets what his hands have sent before him? We have placed veils over their hearts lest they should understand it, and there is heaviness in their ears. Even if you call them to guidance, they will never be guided.","2198":"Your Lord is Forgiving, Owner of Mercy. Had it been His will to take them to task for what they earned, He would have hastened their punishment; but they have an appointed hour from which they will never escape.","2199":"And those villages! When they became evil We destroyed them and appointed a meeting for their destruction.","2200":"When Moses said to his (assisting) youth: 'I will not give up until I reach the point where the two seas meet even though I should go on for many years'","2201":"But when they came to the point where the two met, they forgot their fish, which made its way burrowing into the sea.","2202":"And when they had gone further, he said to his assisting youth; 'Bring us our breakfast; we are worn out from our journey'","2203":"He replied: 'What do you think, I forgot the fish when we were resting on the rock. None but satan made me forget to mention this it made its way into the sea in a marvelous fashion'","2204":"'This is what we have been seeking' said he, and they retraced their footsteps","2205":"and found one of Our worshipers to whom We had given from Our Mercy, and to whom We had taught knowledge of Ours.","2206":"Moses said to him: 'May I follow you so that you can teach me of that you have learned of righteousness'","2207":"'You will not bear patiently with me' He replied.","2208":"'For how can you bear patiently with that which you have never encompassed in your knowledge'","2209":"He (Moses) said: 'If Allah wills, you shall find me patient, I shall not disobey your order'","2210":"He said: 'If you follow me, you must not question me about anything till I myself speak to you concerning it'","2211":"So they departed. When they boarded a ship, he bored a hole in it. 'What, have you made a hole in it' he said, 'is it to drown its passengers? You have done a dreadful thing'","2212":"'Did I not I tell you' he replied, 'that you would not bear patiently with me'","2213":"Moses said: 'Do not blame me for what I forgot, nor press me to do something which is too difficult'","2214":"and so they departed. Thereafter they met a boy and he killed him. He (Moses) exclaimed: 'What, have you killed a pure soul and it was not done (in retaliation) for a soul you have done a terrible thing'","2215":"'Did I not tell you' he replied, 'that you would not be able to bear patiently with me'","2216":"He (Moses) said: 'If I question you again do not let me be your companion; you already have enough excuse'","2217":"So they departed and thereafter they came to the inhabitants of a village. They asked its inhabitants for some food, but they declined to host them. There, they found a wall about to fall down whereupon his companion restored it. He (Moses) said: 'Had you wished, you could have taken payment for that'","2218":"He said: 'This is the parting between me and you. But now I will tell you the interpretation of that which you could not patiently bear.","2219":"As for the ship, it belonged to poor people working on the sea. I rendered it imperfect because behind them there was a king who was taking every ship by brutal force.","2220":"As for the boy, his parents are believers, and we were afraid lest he should impose on them with his insolence and disbelief.","2221":"It was our wish that their Lord should grant them another in exchange, another better in purity and tenderness.","2222":"As for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city. Beneath it was (buried) a treasure which belonged to them. Their father had been a righteous person and your Lord willed that when they reach manhood to bring out their treasure as a mercy from your Lord. What I did was not done by my own command. That is the interpretation of what you could not bear with patience'","2223":"They will ask you about ThulKarnain (the pious and chosen). Say: 'I will recite to you something of his story.","2224":"We established him in the land and gave him means to all things.","2225":"He journeyed on a way","2226":"until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it setting in a muddy spring, and nearby he found a nation. 'ThulKarnain' We said, 'you must either punish them or show them kindness'","2227":"He replied: 'The evildoer we shall punish. Then he shall return to his Lord and He will punish him with a stern punishment.","2228":"As for he who believes and does good works he shall receive a fine reward in recompense and we shall speak to him with a mild command'","2229":"Then he followed the road,","2230":"until he reached the rising of the sun, he found it rising upon a nation for whom We provided no veil against it to shade them.","2231":"So, We encompassed in knowledge what was with him.","2232":"Then he followed the road,","2233":"when he reached between the two barriers he found on one side of them a nation who could barely understand speech.","2234":"'ThulKarnain' they said, 'Look, Gog and Magog are corrupting the earth. Build for us a barrier between us and them, and we will pay you a tribute'","2235":"He replied: 'That which my Lord has given me is better, therefore help me with all your power, and I will build a barrier between you and between them.","2236":"Bring me ingots of iron' After he had leveled between the two cliffs, he said: 'Blow' And when he made it a fire, he said: 'Bring me molten copper so that I may pour over it'","2237":"Thereafter they could neither scale it, nor could they pierce it.","2238":"He said: 'This is a mercy from my Lord. But when my Lord's promise is come, He will make it dust. The promise of my Lord is true'","2239":"On that day, We will let them surge on one another, and the Horn shall be blown, and We will gather them all together.","2240":"On that Day We shall present Gehenna (Hell) to the unbelievers,","2241":"whose eyes were blinded to My remembrance and they were not able to hear.","2242":"Do the unbelievers think that they can take My worshipers as guides other than Me? We have prepared Gehenna to be the hospitality of the unbelievers.","2243":"Say: 'Shall we tell you of those who are the greatest losers in deeds'","2244":"(They are) those whose striving in this world go astray, while they think that what they are doing are good deeds.","2245":"Those are they who disbelieve the verses of their Lord and deny that they will ever meet Him their deeds have failed. On the Day of Resurrection, We shall not give any weight to them.","2246":"Gehenna is their recompense; because they disbelieved and mocked My verses, and My Messengers.","2247":"The hospitality of those who believe and do good works shall be the Gardens of Paradise","2248":"where they will live for ever and never wish that they should be removed from it.","2249":"Say: 'If the sea were ink for the Words of my Lord, the sea would surely be spent before the Words of my Lord are spent, even if We brought its like for replenishment'","2250":"Say: 'I am only a human like you, revealed to me is that your God is One God.

Yet, never Lord, have I been unblessed in prayer to You.","2255":"Indeed, I fear my kinsmen who will succeed me, for my wife is barren.

If you are fearful'","2269":"'I am the Messenger of your Lord' he replied, 'and have come to give you a pure boy'","2270":"'How shall I bear a son' she answered, 'when I am not touched by a human and not unchaste'","2271":"\"Even so\" he replied, \"as such your Lord has said: 'Easy it is for Me. And We shall make him a sign to mankind and a mercy from Us. It is a matter decreed.'\"","2272":"Thereupon she carried him, and retired to a far off place.","2273":"And when the birthpangs came upon her by the trunk of a palmtree, she said: 'Oh, would that I had died before this and become a thing forgotten'","2274":"He called from below to her: 'Do not sorrow, look, your Lord has provided a rivulet below you,","2275":"and shake the trunk of this palmtree it will drop fresh ripe dates upon you.","2276":"Therefore eat and drink and rejoice with your eyes. If you meet any human say to him: \"I have vowed a fast to the Merciful and will not speak with anyone today.'","2277":"She came to her nation, carrying him; and they said: 'O Mary, you have committed a monstrous thing.","2278":"O sister of Aaron, your father was never an evil man, nor was your mother unchaste'","2279":"So she pointed to him (Prophet Jesus). But they replied: 'How can we speak with a baby in the cradle'","2280":"He (the baby) said: 'I am the worshiper of Allah. Allah has given me the Book and made me a Prophet.","2281":"He made me to be blessed wherever I am, and He has charged me with prayer and charity for as long as I shall live.","2282":"(He has made me) kind to my mother; He has not made me arrogant, unprosperous.","2283":"Peace be upon me on the day I was born, and on the day I die; and on the day when I shall be raised up alive'","2284":"Such was (Prophet) Jesus, the son of Mary. A saying of truth, concerning what they doubt.","2285":"It is not for Allah to take a son! Exaltations to Him! When He decrees a thing He only says: 'Be' and it is.","2286":"Indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord therefore worship Him. That is the Straight Path.","2287":"But the parties have fallen into variance among themselves, then woe to those who disbelieve for the scene of a Dreadful Day.","2288":"How well they will hear and see on the Day when they come before Us! The evildoers are today in clear error.","2289":"Warn them of that Day of Anguish, when the matter is determined whilst heedlessly they disbelieve.","2290":"For We shall inherit the earth and all that are on it. To Us, they shall return.","2291":"Mention in the Book Abraham; He was truthful and a Prophet.","2292":"He said to his father: 'O father, why worship that which can neither see nor hear, nor helps you in anything?","2293":"Father, knowledge has come to me which has not come you, therefore, follow me. I will guide you to a Level Path.","2294":"Father, do not worship satan; for satan has rebelled against the Merciful.","2295":"Father, I fear that the punishment of the Merciful will fall upon you and you will become a guide of satan'","2296":"But he replied: 'Do you shrink away from my gods, Abraham? Surely, if you do not cease I will stone you, so leave me for awhile'","2297":"'Peace be on you' he (Abraham) said, 'I shall call upon my Lord to forgive you, for to me He has been gracious.","2298":"Now I will go away from you and that you call upon, other than Allah. I will call on my Lord. Perhaps I shall not be unblessed in calling my Lord'","2299":"So when he turned away from them and those they worshipped, other than Allah, We gave him Isaac and Jacob. Each of them We made a Prophet,","2300":"and We gave them of Our Mercy and We appointed to them a truthful, highly sincere tongue,","2301":"Mention in the Book, Moses. He was devoted, a Messenger, and a Prophet.","2302":"We called out to him from the right side of the mountain, and drew him near in (Divine) conversation.","2303":"From Our Mercy We gave him, his brother Aaron, a Prophet.","2304":"And mention in the Book, Ishmael; he too was true to his promise, a Messenger and a Prophet.","2305":"And he ordered his people to pray and to give charity and his Lord was pleased with him.","2306":"And mention in the Book, Idris; he too was of the truth and a Prophet,","2307":"We raised him to a high place.","2308":"These are whom Allah has blessed among the Prophets from among the seed of Adam and of those whom We bore with Noah; the descendants ofAbraham, of Israel, and of those whom We have guided and chose. For when the verses of the Merciful were recited to them, they fell down prostrate, weeping.","2309":"But the generation that succeeded them wasted their prayers and followed their desires, so they shall encounter error","2310":"except he who repents and believes and does good works; those shall be admitted to Paradise and shall not be wronged in any way.","2311":"(They shall enter the) Gardens of Eden, which the Merciful has promised His worshipers in the Unseen. Indeed, His promise shall come.","2312":"There, they shall hear no idle talk, but only peace. And there they shall be given their provision at dawn and at the evening.","2313":"That is the Paradise which We shall give the cautious worshipers to inherit.","2314":"(Gabriel said:) 'We do not descend except at the command of your Lord. To Him belongs all that is before us and all that is behind us, and all that lies between. Your Lord does not forget.","2315":"Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, so worship Him, be patient in His worship. Do you know any that can be named with His Name'","2316":"The human says: 'What, when I am dead, shall I be raised to life'","2317":"Will the human not remember that We created him before when he was not a thing.","2318":"By your Lord, We will gather them and the satans, and We shall parade them hobbling on their knees in Gehenna:","2319":"from every party We will pluck out whichever of them was the most hardened in disdain of the Most Merciful.","2320":"We alone know who deserves most to be burned therein.","2321":"There is not one of you who shall not go down to it: such is a thing decreed, determined by your Lord.","2322":"Then, We will save those who were cautious of Us, but the harmdoers shall be left there hobbling on their knees.","2323":"When Our clear verses are recited to them the unbelievers say to the believers: 'Which of the two parties has a better position or company'","2324":"How many generations have We destroyed before them, who were far greater in riches and more boastful!","2325":"Say: 'Whosoever is in error, let the Most Merciful prolong his life span until they see that which they were threatened, be it a punishment, or the Hour. Thenshall they know whose is the worst place and who is weaker in hosts'","2326":"Allah will increase those who were guided in guidance and things that abide. Good deeds are better in reward with your Lord, and, better in return.","2327":"Have you seen he who disbelieves Our verses and yet says: 'I shall surely be given wealth and children'","2328":"Has he gained knowledge of the Unseen? Or taken a covenant with the Merciful?","2329":"On the contrary, We will write down what he says and prolong the length of his punishment.","2330":"We shall inherit that of which he speaks and he will come before Us alone.","2331":"And they have taken gods, other than Allah, that they might be a power from them.","2332":"Indeed no! They will renounce their worship and turn against them.","2333":"Have you not seen how We send down to the unbelievers satans who prick them?","2334":"Therefore, do not hasten (things) against them, for We count out to them a number,","2335":"and on the Day when We will ceremonially gather the righteous to the Merciful,","2336":"and drive the evildoers as herds, into Gehenna","2337":"who have no power of intercession, except those who have taken a covenant with the Merciful.","2338":"And they say: 'The Merciful has taken a son'","2339":"Surely, you have brought a monstrous thing!","2340":"Thereby the heavens are nearly torn and the earth split asunder, and mountains fall crashing down","2341":"because they have ascribed a son to the Merciful.","2342":"It is not for the Merciful to take a son!","2343":"There is none in the heavens and earth except he comes to the Merciful as a worshiper.","2344":"He has counted them and exactly numbered all;","2345":"and each one shall come to Him on the Day of Resurrection, alone.","2346":"Those who believe and do righteous deeds, the Merciful will assign for them love.","2347":"We have made it easy in your own tongue in order that you proclaim the glad tidings to the cautious and give warning to a stubborn nation.","2348":"How many generations have We destroyed before them! Do you sense even one of them, or hear a whisper from them?","2349":"TaHa.","2350":"We have not sent down the Koran to you for you to be tired,","2351":"but as a reminder to he who fears.","2352":"It is a sending down from Him who has created the earth, and the high heavens,","2353":"the Merciful willed to the Throne.","2354":"To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth, and all that lies between them, and underneath the soil.","2355":"If you speak loudly; He has indeed knowledge of the secret and the hidden.","2356":"Allah, there is no god except He. To Him belong the most Beautiful Names.","2357":"Has the story of Moses reached you?","2358":"When he saw a fire, he said to his family: 'Stay here, for I can see a fire. Perhaps I can bring you a lighted torch or find at the fire guidance'","2359":"When he reached it, he was called: 'O Moses,","2360":"I am your Lord. Take off your shoes, for you are in Towa, the sacred valley.","2361":"I have chosen you. Therefore, listen to what shall be revealed.","2362":"Indeed, I am Allah. There is no god except Me. Worship Me, and establish the prayer of My remembrance.","2363":"The Hour is coming. I almost conceal it, so that every soul will be recompensed for its labors.","2364":"Do not let those who disbelieve in it and follow their desires bar you from it, or you will perish.","2365":"What is that in your right hand, Moses'","2366":"'It is my staff,\" Moses replied, \"upon it I lean and with it I beat down leaves to feed my sheep and for me there are other uses in it'","2367":"He said: 'Moses, cast it down'","2368":"So he cast it down, and thereupon it turned into a sliding serpent.","2369":"'Take it, and do not fear' He said, 'We will restore it to its former state.","2370":"Now, put your hand under your armpit. It shall come out white, without evil, a second sign.","2371":"But We shall show you some of Our greatest signs.","2372":"24 Go to Pharaoh, he has become insolent'","2373":"'Lord' said Moses, 'expand my chest,","2374":"and ease my task for me.","2375":"Unloose the knot upon my tongue,","2376":"that they may understand my speech.","2377":"Appoint for me a minister from my family","2378":"Aaron, my brother.","2379":"By him confirm my strength","2380":"and let him share my task,","2381":"so that we exalt You","2382":"and remember You abundantly.","2383":"You are surely seeing us'","2384":"He replied: 'Moses, your request is granted.","2385":"We had already shown you favor","2386":"when We revealed what was to be made known to your mother,","2387":"saying: \"Put him in the box and cast it into the river. The river will cast him on to the bank, and he shall be taken up by an enemy of Mine and an enemy of his.\" I lavished My Love on you, and to be formed in My Sight.","2388":"Your sister went (to them) and said: 'Shall I guide you to one who will nurse him' And so We restored you to your mother, so that her eyes might rejoice and that she might not sorrow. And when you killed a soul We saved you from grief and then We tried you with many trials. You stayed among the people of Midian for a number of years, and then, Moses, you came here according to a decree.","2389":"I have chosen you for Me.","2390":"Go, you and your brother with My signs, and do not be negligent of My Remembrance.","2391":"Go to Pharaoh, for he has become insolent.","2392":"Speak to him with gentle words; perhaps he will ponder or fear'","2393":"'O our Lord' both said, 'We fear lest he may be excessive against us or become insolent'","2394":"He replied: 'Have no fear I shall be with you, both hearing and seeing.","2395":"Both of you go to him (Pharaoh) and say: \"We are the Messengers of your Lord. Let the Children of Israel depart with us, and do not punish them. We have come to you with a sign from your Lord; peace be on him who follows guidance!","2396":"It is revealed to us that a punishment will fall on those who belie and turn away.\"","2397":"He (Pharaoh) said: 'Moses, who is the Lord of you both'","2398":"'Our Lord' he replied, 'is He Who gave everything its creation and then guided it'","2399":"He (Pharaoh) asked: 'How was it then, with the former generations'","2400":"He (Moses) answered: 'The knowledge of them is in a Book with My Lord. My Lord neither goes astray, nor forgets.","2401":"It is He who has made for you the earth as a cradle and threaded roads for you and sends down water from the sky with which We bring forth every kind of plant.","2402":"You eat and let your cattle graze' Surely, in this there are signs for those of understanding.","2403":"We created you from it (the earth), and to it We shall restore you; and from it We will bring you forth yet a second time.","2404":"So We showed him (Pharaoh) Our signs, all of them, but he belied and refused them.","2405":"He said: 'Moses, have you come to drive us from our land with your sorcery?","2406":"We will indeed bring sorcery similar to yours. Appoint a meeting place between us and you, in a place which is agreeable to both which neither we nor you shall not fail (to keep)'","2407":"He (Moses) replied: 'Your meeting shall be on the day of the feast, and let the people be assembled by midmorning'","2408":"So Pharaoh withdrew and gathered his guile, then returned,","2409":"and Moses said to them: 'Alas! Do not forge a lie against Allah lest He destroys you with a punishment. Indeed, whosoever forges has failed'","2410":"They disputed upon their plan with one another, and spoke in secret","2411":"saying: 'These two are sorcerers whose aim is to drive you from your land by their sorcery and destroy your noble ways.","2412":"Gather your guile and then lineup a rank those who gain the upper hand today shall indeed prosper'","2413":"They said to Moses: 'Will you throw down or shall we be the first?","2414":"Moses replied: 'No, you throw first' And by their sorcery it seemed to him that their ropes and staffs were sliding.","2415":"Moses became fearful within himself.","2416":"But We said to him: 'Do not be afraid; you shall surely be the uppermost.","2417":"Throw that which is in your right hand. It will swallow up that which they have made, for that which they made is but the guile of a sorcerer. Wherever he goes the sorcerer does not prosper'","2418":"Thereafter the sorcerers threw themselves down, prostrating, saying: 'We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses'","2419":"'Have you believed him before I have given you permission' he (Pharaoh) said. 'Indeed, he (must be) your chief, the one who taught you sorcery. I will cut off on opposite sides a hand and a foot then crucify you on the trunks of palmtrees. Indeed, you shall know whose punishment is more stern, and more lasting'","2420":"Their reply was: 'We will not prefer you over the clear signs that have come to us, nor over Him who has created us. So decide upon whatever you decide, you can only decided upon things in this present life.","2421":"We believe in our Lord so that He forgives us our sins and the sorcery you have forced us to practice. Allah is Better, and Everlasting'","2422":"Gehenna (Hell) awaits whosoever comes before his Lord as a sinner, there he shall neither die nor live.","2423":"But for whosoever comes before Him as a believer and having done good works there awaits the most highest degree;","2424":"living for ever in the Gardens of Eden, underneath which rivers flow. Such shall be the recompense of he who purifies himself.","2425":"To Moses we also revealed: 'Set forth with My worshipers by night and strike for them a dry path in the sea. Do not fear that you will be overtaken, neither be afraid'","2426":"Pharaoh pursued them with his legions so they were overwhelmed from the sea with that which drowned them.","2427":"For Pharaoh had misled his nation, and did not guide them.","2428":"Children of Israel! We saved you from your enemies and made a covenant with you on the right side of the Mountain. We sent down manna and quails.","2429":"'Eat of the good things with which We have provided you and do not transgress therein lest My Anger should fall upon you, and upon whosoever My Anger falls has assuredly fallen,","2430":"but to whosoever repents, believes and does good deeds, and is at last guided, I am Forgiving'","2431":"'Moses, why have you come with such haste from your nation'","2432":"Moses replied: 'They are following me. My Lord, I made haste only so that I might please You'","2433":"He (Allah) said: 'We tempted your nation in your absence, and the Samaritan has misled them into error'","2434":"With great anger and sorrow, Moses returned to his nation. 'My nation' he said, 'did your Lord not make you a fine promise? Did the time of the covenant seem long to you? Or did you desire that the anger of your Lord should fall upon you so that you failed in your coming to my appointment'","2435":"They replied: 'We have not failed in our promise to you through our choosing. We were laden with fardels, even the ornaments of the nation, and threw them just as the Samaritan had thrown them (into the fire),","2436":"and made a calf for them, a figure that lowed. \"This,\" they said, \"is your god and the god of Moses but whom he has forgotten.\"","2437":"What! Did they not see that it did not speak a word to them in return, and for them it could own neither harm nor benefit?","2438":"Aaron had said to them before: 'My nation, you have been tempted by it. Your Lord is the Merciful. Follow me and obey my order'","2439":"They replied: 'We will not stop; we will cling to it until Moses returns to us.'","2440":"He (Moses) said to Aaron: 'When you saw them in error, what prevented you,","2441":"from following after me, did you disobey my order'","2442":"'Son of my mother' he replied, 'Do not seize my beard nor my head. I was afraid that you might say: \"You have divided the Children of Israel and did not uphold my word.\"","2443":"'You, Samaritan' said he (Moses), 'what was your business'","2444":"He replied: 'I saw what they did not see and seized a handful of dust from the foot print of the messenger and so I cast it this my soul prompted me to do'","2445":"'Begone! Your lot in this life is to cry: \"untouchable!' said he (Moses). 'An appointment awaits you that you cannot fail to keep. Look at your god which you clung to indeed we will burn it and scatter its ashes upon the sea'","2446":"Your God is only One, Allah. There is no god, except He, alone. His knowledge encompasses all things.","2447":"And so We narrate to you the stories of the past, and We have given you a remembrance from Us.","2448":"Whosoever has turned away from it shall bear a burden on the Day of Resurrection.","2449":"and live in it for ever; how evil will that burden be for them on the Day of Resurrection.","2450":"The Day when the Horn shall be blown. On that Day, We shall assemble all the sinners with blued eyes,","2451":"and they shall murmur among themselves: 'You have stayed away but ten (days and nights)'","2452":"We know well what they will say. The most just among them in the matter will declare: 'You have stayed away but one day'","2453":"They will question you about the mountains. Say: 'My Lord will scatter them as ashes","2454":"and leave them a desolate waste,","2455":"with neither crookedness nor any curving to be seen therein'","2456":"On that Day, they will follow the Summoner, who is not crooked, their voices hushed before the Merciful, and you shall hear nothing except a murmuring.","2457":"On that Day intercession will not benefit them except him that has received the permission of the Merciful and whose words are pleased by Him.","2458":"He knows what is before them and behind them, and they do not comprehend Him in knowledge.","2459":"(All) faces shall be humbled before the Living One, the Eternal. Those who are burdened with wrong doing shall have failed,","2460":"but those who have believed and done good works shall fear neither wrong nor injustice.","2461":"As such We sent it down, an Arabic Koran, and explained in it threats in order that they be cautious, or, that it prompts the Remembrance in them.","2462":"Highly exalted be Allah, the true King! Do not hasten with the Koran before its revelation has been completed to you, but say: 'Lord, increase me in knowledge'","2463":"We made a covenant with Adam, but he forgot and We found in him no constancy.","2464":"And when We said to the angels: 'Prostrate yourselves before Adam' they all prostrated themselves except iblis, who refused.","2465":"'Adam' We said, 'This is you and your wife's enemy. Do not let him expel you from the Garden, so that you (Adam) will be tired.","2466":"It has been given to you so that you shall neither become hungry nor naked therein;","2467":"there, (you shall) neither thirst, nor suffer from the sun'","2468":"But satan whispered to him saying: 'Adam, shall I direct you the Tree of Eternity and a kingdom which never decays'","2469":"They both ate of it, and their shameful parts appeared to them, whereupon they began to stitch upon themselves leaves from the Garden. And so it was, Adam erred and disobeyed his Lord.","2470":"But afterwards his Lord chose him; He turned again towards him and guided him.","2471":"'Both of you, together, go down out of it (the Garden) each of you an enemy to the other' He said: 'but, if My Guidance comes to you, whosoever followsMy Guidance shall neither go astray nor be unprosperous;","2472":"but whosoever turns away from My remembrance, his life shall be narrow and on the Day of Resurrection We shall raise him blind'","2473":"'My Lord' he will say: 'why have You raised me blind when I was able to see'","2474":"He (Allah) will say: 'It is so, Our verses came to you and you forgot them. So this Day you are forgotten'","2475":"In this way We recompense the prodigal who disbelieves the verses of his Lord. But the punishment of the Everlasting Life is more terrible and everlasting.","2476":"Is it not a guidance to them, how many generations We destroyed before them in whose dwelling places they walk? Surely, in this there are signs for thoseof reason.","2477":"Except for a Word that preceded from your Lord, and a stated term, it had been fastened.","2478":"Therefore, be patient with what they say, and exalt with the praise of your Lord before sunrise and before sunset. And in the watches of the night and at the edges of the day, exalt Him, so that you will be pleasing.","2479":"Do not stretch your eyes at the flower of this life which We have given couples to enjoy, it is with this that We might try them; and the provision of yourLord is better, and more enduring.","2480":"Order your family to pray and be patient in it. We do not ask you for provisions, rather, it is We who provide for you. And the final outcome is for the cautious.","2481":"They say: 'Why does he not bring us a sign from his Lord' Did not a clear sign come to them in the preceding Scrolls?","2482":"Had We destroyed them with a punishment before this, they would have said: 'Our Lord, why did You not send us a Messenger so that we could have followed Your verses before we were humiliated and degraded'","2483":"Say: 'Everyone is waiting; so wait. Indeed, you shall know who are the companions of the Even Path, and those who are guided'","2484":"The Reckoning for mankind is drawing near, yet they are heedless and turn away.","2485":"No recent revival of the remembrance comes to them from their Lord, except that they play with it as they listen","2486":"their hearts are diverted. The harmdoers mutter to one another: 'Is this anything else but a human like yourself? What, will you follow sorcery with your eyes open'","2487":"He said: 'My Lord has knowledge of what is said in the heavens and on earth. He is the Hearer, the Knower'","2488":"Some say: 'No, it is only mixed dreams' 'No, he has forged it himself', or, 'no, he is a poet! Let him bring us a sign, just as the ancient ones were sent asMessengers'","2489":"Of the villages We destroyed, there was not one that believed. What, will they not believe?","2490":"We never sent (anyone) before you except men to whom We revealed to them. 'Ask the people of the Remembrance if you do not know'","2491":"Nor did We make them bodies that ate no food, nor were they immortal.","2492":"Then We were true to the promise, We saved them together with those whom We willed, and destroyed the transgressors.","2493":"Now, We have sent down to you a Book in which is your Remembrance. Will you not understand?","2494":"How many harmdoing villages have We shattered and replaced them with another nation.","2495":"And when they felt Our Might they fled from it.","2496":"'Do not run away. Return to your luxury that you rejoiced in, and your homes in order that you be questioned'","2497":"They said: 'Alas for us we were harmdoers'","2498":"And this they did not stop crying out until We made them stubble, silent, and still.","2499":"It was not in play that We created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them.","2500":"Had We wished to take to Us an amusement We would have taken it to Us from Ours had We done so.","2501":"No, We hurl truth at falsehood, and it shall conquer it, and see, falsehood vanishes. Woe to you for all you have described.","2502":"To Him belongs whosoever is in the heavens and the earth. Those who are with Him are not too proud to worship Him, nor are they ever wearied.","2503":"They never fail to exalt Him either at night or in the day.","2504":"Or, have they taken earthly gods who revive the dead?","2505":"Had there been gods in heaven or earth, other than Allah, both would indeed have been ruined. Exalted be Allah, Lord of the Throne, above that they describe.","2506":"He is not to be questioned about what He does, but they shall be questioned.","2507":"Have they taken gods, other than Him? Say: 'Bring us your proof! Here is the Remembrance of he who is with me and the Remembrance of those before me' But no, most of them do not know the truth, therefore they turn away.","2508":"We never sent a Messenger before you except that We revealed to him saying: 'There is no god except Me, therefore, worship Me'","2509":"They say 'The Merciful has taken a son' Exaltations to Him! No, they are only His honored worshipers,","2510":"who do not surpass Him in speech, and do as He commands.","2511":"He knows what is before them and what is behind them. They intercede for none except for him whom He is well pleased, and they tremble in awe of Him.","2512":"If any one of them says: 'I am a god other than Him' We will recompense him with Gehenna (Hell). As such We recompense the harmdoers.","2513":"Have the unbelievers not seen that the heavens and the earth were sewn up as one (solid) mass, then We unstitched them, and that We made every living thing of water? Will they not believe!","2514":"We set firm mountains upon the earth lest it should shake with them, and We placed therein ravines to be paths so that they might be guided.","2515":"We established the heaven as a well protected roof, yet they still turn away from its signs.","2516":"It is He who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon; each floating in an orbit.","2517":"We have never assigned immortality to a human before you, therefore, if you yourself die, will they live for ever?","2518":"Every soul shall taste death. We will try you with a trial of evil and good. Then, to Us you shall be returned.","2519":"When the unbelievers see you, they take you only for mockery, saying: 'Is this he who talks about your gods' While they are unbelievers in the Remembrance of the Merciful.","2520":"The human was created of haste. Indeed, I will show you My signs; so do not ask Me to hasten them.","2521":"They say: 'If you are truthful, when will this promise come'","2522":"If the unbelievers only knew when they will be unable to shield either their faces or their backs from the Fire; when they will not be helped!","2523":"It will overtake them suddenly, dumbfounding them. They shall be unable to ward it off, and they shall not be respited.","2524":"Before you, other Messengers were mocked, but the mockers were encompassed by the very thing they mocked.","2525":"Say: 'Who will guard you, by night and by day from the Merciful' But no, they turn away from their Lord's remembrance.","2526":"Or have they gods to defend them, other than Us? Indeed, they are unable to help themselves, neither shall they be guarded in safety from Us.","2527":"We gave days of enjoyment to them and their fathers until their life became long. Are they unable to see how We come to their land and reduce its borders. Or, is it they who are the victors?","2528":"Say: 'I warn you only by the Revelation' But the deaf hear nothing when they are warned.","2529":"But if just a breath of your Lord's punishment were to touch them, they would say: 'Woe for us, we were harmdoers'","2530":"On the Day of Resurrection We shall set up just scales, so that no soul shall in the least be wronged, even though it be the weight of a grain of mustard seedWe will bring it We Suffice as reckoners.","2531":"We gave Moses and Aaron the Criterion, and gave them a light and a Remembrance for the cautious:","2532":"those who fear Allah in the Unseen, tremble because of the Hour.","2533":"This is a blessed Remembrance which We have sent down. Do you disbelieve it?","2534":"Before this We gave Abraham his virtue, for We knew him.","2535":"He said to his father and to his nation: 'What, are these the statues to which you cling'","2536":"They replied: 'We found our fathers worshipping them'","2537":"He said: 'Truly, you and your fathers are in clear error'","2538":"They said: 'Is it the truth you have brought us, or are you one of those that play'","2539":"'No' he answered, 'your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Originator of them, and I am among those bearing witness to it.","2540":"By Allah, I will certainly outwit your idols as soon as you have turned your backs and gone'","2541":"He broke them all into pieces, except their great one so that they might return to it.","2542":"'Who has done this to our gods' they exclaimed. 'He must surely be a harmdoer'","2543":"'We have heard a young man called Abraham mention them' they replied.","2544":"They said: 'Then bring him here so that the people may see, so that they may bear witness'","2545":"'Abraham' they said, 'was it you who did this to our gods'","2546":"'No' he replied. 'It was their great one amongst them that did it. Ask them, if they are able to speak'","2547":"So they returned one to another saying, 'Surely, it is you who are the harmdoers'","2548":"But then they reversed their minds: 'You know they do not speak'","2549":"He said: 'Would you then worship that, instead of Allah, which can neither help nor harm you?","2550":"Shame on you and on that you worship other than Allah! Have you no understanding'","2551":"They said: 'Burn him and help your gods, if you are going to do anything'","2552":"'O Fire' We said, 'be coolness and safety for Abraham'","2553":"They sought to outwit him, but We made them the worst of losers.","2554":"We saved him and Lot, and brought them to the land which We had blessed for all the worlds.","2555":"We gave him, in excess, Isaac, and Jacob (for a grandson); and We made each righteous","2556":"and appointed them leaders to guide by Our Command and We revealed to them to do good deeds, and to establish the prayer, and the giving of charity, and they were for Us worshipers.","2557":"To Lot, We gave judgment and knowledge and saved him from the village that had been committing corrupt deeds; for they were an evil nation and were debauched.","2558":"We admitted him to Our Mercy, he was among the righteous.","2559":"And (remember) Noah, when he supplicated to Us, We answered him, and We saved him and his nation from great distress,","2560":"and helped him against the nation who had belied Our signs. They were an evil nation; We drowned them all.","2561":"And David and Solomon they passed judgment upon the tilled land on which the people? s sheep had strayed. We bore witness to their judgment, and","2562":"We made Solomon to understand it, and to both We gave judgment and knowledge. And with David We subjected the mountains and birds to exalt (Allah). All this We have done.","2563":"We taught him the craft of making garments that fortify you against your own violence. Are you thankful?","2564":"To Solomon the raging wind ran at his command to the land which We had blessed. We have knowledge of all things.","2565":"And some of the satans dived for him and others did work as well. We were watching over them.","2566":"And Job when he called to his Lord: 'Affliction has befallen me, and You are the Most Merciful of the merciful'","2567":"We answered him and removed his affliction, and We gave his people, and those like them that were with them, mercy from Us, as a reminder to those who worship.","2568":"And Ishmael, Idris, and ThulKifl (the son of Job) each were patient.","2569":"We admitted them to Our Mercy, for they were of the righteous.","2570":"And ThulNun (Prophet Jonah), he went away in anger thinking We had no power over him. But in the darkness he cried: 'There is no god except You. Exaltations to You! I was among the harmdoers'","2571":"We heard his prayer and saved him from grief. As such We shall save the believers.","2572":"And Zachariah when he called to his Lord saying: 'Lord, do not let me remain by myself; You are the Best of inheritors'","2573":"So We answered him, and gave him John, curing his wife (of sterility). They raced with each other in good works and called on Us out of yearning and awe, and they were humble to Us.","2574":"And she (Mary) who guarded her virginity. We breathed into her of Our spirit (Gabriel), and made her and her son a sign for the worlds.","2575":"Indeed, this nation of yours is one nation, and I am Your Lord, therefore worship Me.","2576":"But they (the Christians and Jews) split their affair between them all shall return to Us.","2577":"The endeavors of he who believes and does good works shall not go unthanked. We write it down for him.","2578":"(It is ordained that) no village We have destroyed shall return","2579":"till Gog and Magog are let loose and slide down out of every slope;","2580":"when the true promise draws near; the eyes of the unbelievers will stare (and they will say): 'Alas for us! Of this we have been heedless. We have beenharmdoers'","2581":"You and all those who you were worshipping, other than Allah, shall be the fuel of Gehenna; there you shall all go down to it.","2582":"If those had been gods, they would never have gone down to it, but in it they shall live for ever.","2583":"There is groaning for them therein, and they do not hear.","2584":"But those whom We have surpassed with the finest (rank) from Us shall be far removed from it,","2585":"neither shall they hear any of its whisper, but shall live for ever in that their souls desired.","2586":"The greatest terror shall not grieve them, and the angels will receive them: 'This is the Day you have been promised'","2587":"On that Day, We shall roll up the heaven like a written scroll is rolled. As We originated the first creation, so will We bring it back again. This is a binding promise on Us which We shall assuredly fulfill.","2588":"We have written in the Psalms, after the Remembrance: 'The righteous among My worshipers shall inherit the earth'","2589":"Surely, in this is a proclamation to a worshiping nation.","2590":"We have not sent you (Prophet Muhammad) except as a mercy to all the worlds.","2591":"Say: 'It is revealed to me that your God is One God, do you then surrender'","2592":"If they turn back, say: 'I have warned you all alike, though I cannot tell whether what you are promised is imminent or distant.","2593":"He knows your spoken words and what you hide.","2594":"And I do not know if this is a trial for you and an enjoyment for a time'","2595":"He said: 'My Lord, judge in truth. Our Lord is the Merciful whose help is ever to be sought against what you describe'","2596":"O people, have fear of your Lord. The earthquake of the Hour shall be a great thing.","2597":"On that Day you will see every one that suckles shall forsake her suckling, and every carrier shall miscarry, and you shall see mankind drunk although they arenot drunk; dreadful will be the punishment of Allah.","2598":"Among people there are those, who without knowledge, dispute about Allah and follow every rebel satan,","2599":"against whom it is written down that whosoever takes him for a guide, he guides astray, and leads him to the punishment of the Blaze.","2600":"O people, if you are in doubt about the Resurrection, remember that We first created you from dust, then, from a sperm drop, then from a clot, and then from a bitesize tissue formed and unformed, so that We might clarify for you. We establish in the wombs whatever We will for an appointed term, and then We bring you forth as infants, then you come of age. Some of you die, and some of you are kept back to the vilest state of life, after knowing somewhat, they know nothing. And you see the earth dry; but no sooner do We send down rain upon it than it begins to quiver and swell, putting forth every fine variety (of herbage).","2601":"That is because Allah is the Truth; He revives the dead and has power over all things.","2602":"And the Hour is sure to come there is no doubt. And Allah will raise up those in the graves.","2603":"Some dispute about Allah, though they have neither knowledge nor guidance, nor an illuminating Book.","2604":"There is for him who turns his side to lead (others) astray from the Path of Allah, degradation in this life and We shall let him taste the punishment of theburning on the Day of Resurrection.","2605":"'This, is the reward for what your hands have forwarded. Allah is not unjust to the worshipers'","2606":"There are among the people such who worship Allah and (yet stand) on the very edge. When goodness comes to him, he is content, but if a trial befalls him he falls upon his face, he loses this world and the Everlasting Life; that is indeed a clear loss.","2607":"He calls to other than Allah, to that which neither hurts him, nor benefits him; that is indeed far error.","2608":"He calls upon him whose harm is nearer than his benefit, an evil guide and an evil friend.","2609":"As for those who believe and do good works Allah will admit them to gardens underneath which rivers flow. Allah indeed does what He will.","2610":"If any one thinks that Allah will not give him (Prophet Muhammad) victory in this present world and in the Everlasting Life, let him stretch a rope to heaven, and let him sever it. Then, let him see if his guile does away with that which has enraged him.","2611":"As such We have sent it in clear verses. Indeed, Allah gives guidance to whom He will.","2612":"Surely, they that believe, and those of Jewry, the Sabaeans, the Nazarenes, the Magians, and the unbelievers, Allah will judge them on the Day of Resurrection. Surely, Allah is witness over everything.","2613":"Have you not seen that to Allah prostrate all who are in the heavens and all who are in the earth, the sun and the moon, the stars and the mountains, the trees and the beasts, and many people? And many deserve the punishment. He who is abased by Allah has none to honor him. Allah does what He will.","2614":"Those are two who disputed concerning their Lord. Garments of fire have been prepared for the unbelievers. Boiling water shall be poured over their heads,","2615":"and that which is in their bellies and their skins shall be melted;","2616":"for them are hooked rods of iron.","2617":"Whenever in their anguish they try to get out of it, they are restored to it. (It will be said): 'Taste the punishment of burning'","2618":"Allah will admit those who believe and do good works to gardens underneath which rivers flow. They shall be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and with pearls, and their garments shall be of silk.","2619":"For they shall be guided to good speech and guided to the praised path.","2620":"The unbelievers who bar from the Way of Allah and from the Holy Mosque which We made equal for all peoples, he who cleaves to it and the tentdweller alike, and whosoever seeks to violate it wrongfully, We shall let him taste a painful punishment.","2621":"And when We settled for Abraham (and Ishmael) the place of the Holy Mosque, (We said): 'You shall not associate with Me anything. Purify My House for those who circumambulate it and those who stand, for those who bow and prostrate.","2622":"Proclaim the pilgrimage to the people. They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel, they shall come from every deep ravine;","2623":"that they witness profitable things for them and mention the Name of Allah on well known days over the flocks which He has provided them. Eat thereof, and feed the wretched poor.","2624":"Then, let the pilgrims accomplish their acts of cleansing, and let them fulfill their vows, and circumambulate the Ancient House.","2625":"All that; and whosoever venerates the sacred rites of Allah it shall be better for him with his Lord. The flocks are lawful to you, except that which is recited to you. Therefore, avoid the filth of idols and avoid speaking falsely,","2626":"being of pure faith to Allah, not associating anything with Him. He who associates others with Allah is like he who falls from heaven and is snatched away by the birds or carried by the wind to some faroff place.","2627":"All that; and, he who venerates the waymarks of Allah, surely it is from the piety of the hearts.","2628":"In them, you have benefits until an appointed time. After their place of sacrifice is at the Ancient House.","2629":"For every nation We have appointed a holy ritual, that they pronounce the Name of Allah over the beast of flocks which He has provided them. Your God isOne God; to Him surrender yourselves. Give glad tidings to the humble,","2630":"whose hearts, when Allah is mentioned, quake, who endure their misfortunes with patience, and establish their prayers, and spend of that which We have provided them.","2631":"And the camels We have made a part of the waymarks of Allah. In them is good for you. Pronounce over them the Name of Allah, when they are hobbled; and when they have fallen down on their sides, eat of them and feed the impoverished nonrequestor and the requestor. As such We have subjected them to you, in order that you give thanks.","2632":"Their flesh and blood does not reach Allah rather it is piety from you that reaches Him. As such He has subjected them to you, in order that you exalt Allahfor guiding you. And give glad tidings to the generous.","2633":"Allah will defend those who believe. Verily, Allah does not love the ungrateful cheat.","2634":"Permission is given to those who fight because they were wronged. Allah has power to grant them victory:","2635":"those who have been unjustly driven from their homes, just because they said: 'Our Lord is Allah' Had Allah not repelled some people by the means ofothers, the monasteries and churches, the synagogues and mosques in which the Name of Allah is remembered would have been destroyed. But whoever helps Allah shall be helped by Him. Allah is the Strong, the Almighty,","2636":"those who, if We established them in the land, will establish the prayers and pay the obligatory charity, order with honor and forbid dishonor, and to Allah is the end of all affairs.","2637":"If they belie you, so too before them, the nation of Noah belied, and Aad and Thamood","2638":"and the nation of Abraham and the nation of Lot;","2639":"and the inhabitants of Midian, to Moses they also belied. I respited the unbelievers, then I seized them, and how was My disapproval!","2640":"How many a village We have destroyed in its harmdoing, so that it lies fallen upon its turrets, and how many an abandoned well, and empty palace!","2641":"Have they never journeyed through the land so that they have hearts to understand, or ears to hear with? It is not the eyes, but the hearts in the chests that are blind.","2642":"They ask you to hasten the punishment. Allah will not break His promise. Each day with your Lord is like a thousand years in your reckoning.","2643":"And how many a village have I respited in its evil doing! Then I seized it. To Me is the return.","2644":"Say (Prophet Muhammad): 'O people, I have been sent to warn you plainly.","2645":"Those who believe and do good works, theirs shall be forgiveness and a generous provision;","2646":"but those who strive to void Our verses, thinking they have escaped, shall be the people of Hell'","2647":"Never have We sent a Messenger or a Prophet before you, but when he hoped, satan tampered with his hope. But Allah supersedes the tampering of satan and confirms His verses. And Allah is the Knower, the Wise.","2648":"(This He permits) in order that He makes satan's interjections a temptation for those in whose hearts is a sickness and those whose hearts are hardened and the harmdoers are in a wide schism,","2649":"and so that those to whom knowledge has been given will know that this is the truth from your Lord and so believe in it and that their hearts will be humble to Him. Indeed, Allah will surely guide those who believe to a Straight Path.","2650":"The unbelievers will never cease to doubt it until the Hour overtakes them suddenly or the punishment of the Barren Day comes upon them.","2651":"The Kingdom upon that Day shall belong to Allah. He will judge between them. Those who believe and do good works shall be in Gardens of Bliss,","2652":"but for those who disbelieved Our verses and belied there awaits a humbling punishment.","2653":"As for those who emigrated in the way of Allah and were slain, or died, Allah will provide them with fine provisions. Allah is the Best of providers.","2654":"He will admit them by a gate that is pleasing to them, and surely, Allah is the Knower, the Clement.","2655":"So shall it be. He who punishes after the manner that he was punished and then again is oppressed, shall be helped by Allah. Allah is Pardoning, Forgiving.","2656":"That is because Allah causes the night to enter into the day, and the day enter into the night. Allah is the Hearer and the Seer.","2657":"That is because Allah is the Truth, and falsehood is all that they call upon, other than Him. Allah is the Most High, the Most Great.","2658":"Do you not see that Allah sends down water from the sky and in the morning the earth becomes green? Allah is Subtle, the Aware.","2659":"To Him belong all that is in the heavens and earth, surely, Allah is the Rich, the Praised.","2660":"Do you not see that Allah has subjected to you all that is on the earth, and the ships which run upon the sea by His command? He holds the sky back lest it should fall upon the earth except by His permission. Allah is Gentle to people, the Most Merciful.","2661":"It is He who revives you, then He will cause you to die and then He revives you. Indeed, the human is ungrateful.","2662":"For every nation We have appointed a Holy Rite which they shall perform. Do not let them dispute with you concerning the matter. Call to your Lord; surely, you are upon a Straight Path.","2663":"If they argue with you, say: 'Allah knows best all that you do.","2664":"On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will judge between you concerning that in which you vary.","2665":"Are you not aware that Allah has knowledge of what is in the heaven and earth? This is (recorded) in a Book. That is easy for Allah.","2666":"Yet they worship that for which He did not send down authority, and that of which they have no knowledge. Indeed, the harmdoers shall have no helpers.","2667":"When Our clear verses are recited to them, you will recognize denial upon the faces of the unbelievers. They nearly rush upon those who recite Our verses to them. Say: 'Shall I tell you what is worse than that' The Fire which Allah has promised those who disbelieve an evil arrival'","2668":"People, this is a parable, listen to it. Those whom you call upon, other than Allah, could never create a fly, though they banded together to do this. And if a fly robs them of anything, they could never rescue it from it. The seeker and the sought are alike in their weakness.","2669":"They do not value Allah as He should be valued. For Allah is Powerful and Mighty.","2670":"Allah chooses Messengers from angels and from people. Allah is the Hearer, the Seer.","2671":"He knows what is before them and behind them. To Allah all things are returned.","2672":"O you who believe, bow down and prostrate yourselves. Worship your Lord and do good, in order that you prosper.","2673":"Struggle for Allah as is due to Him. He has chosen you and has not laden a burden upon you in your religion, being the Creed of Abraham your father. He has named you Muslims before and in this so that the Messenger (Muhammad) can be a witness for you, and in order that you be witnesses against mankind. Therefore, establish the prayer and pay the obligatory charity and hold fast to Allah. He is your Guardian, the Excellent Guardian, the Excellent Helper!","2674":"Prosperous are the believers,","2675":"who are humble in their prayers;","2676":"who turn away from idle talk;","2677":"who give charity,","2678":"who guard their privates,","2679":"except with their wives and what their right hand possess, and then they are not blamed.","2680":"Those who seek beyond that are transgressors.","2681":"(Prosperous are those) who preserve their trusts and pledges","2682":"and those who observe their prayers.","2683":"Those are the heirs","2684":"who will inherit Paradise; they shall live there for ever.","2685":"We created the human from an essence of clay:","2686":"then We made him, a drop, in a secure receptacle (the womb).","2687":"Then We created of the drop, a clot (of congealed blood) and We created the clot into bitesize tissue, then We created the bitesize tissue into bones, thenWe clothed the bones with flesh, and then produced it an other creation. Blessed is Allah, the Best of creators!","2688":"After that you shall surely die,","2689":"and be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection.","2690":"We have created seven ways above you; of Our creation, We are never inattentive.","2691":"We sent down water from the sky in due measure, and lodged it in the earth, and We are able to take it all away.","2692":"With it, We produced for you gardens of palms and vines, yielding abundant fruit for you to eat.","2693":"Also, a tree which grows on the Tor of Sinai and gives oil and relish for its eaters.","2694":"In the cattle, too, is a lesson for you. We let you drink of that which is in their bellies, and there are many benefits in them for you, and you eat of them,","2695":"and upon them and on the ships you are carried.","2696":"We sent Noah to his nation. 'Worship Allah, my nation' he said, 'for you have no god except He. Will you not be cautious'","2697":"The unbelieving assembly of his nation said: 'This is but a human like you, who desires to gain superiority over you. Had Allah willed, He could have sent down angels. We never heard of this among our ancient forefathers.","2698":"He is nothing else except a man who is mad, so watch him for awhile.","2699":"He (Noah) said: 'Lord, help me, for they belie me'","2700":"We said to him: 'Make the Ark under Our Eye, and Our Revelation, and then when Our command comes and the oven gushes water, take onboard a pair from every kind and your family, except him against whom the decision has already been passed. Do not address Me concerning those who have done evil; they shall be drowned.","2701":"And when you and all those with you are seated in the Ark, say: 'Praise be to Allah who has saved us from the harmdoing nation'","2702":"And say: 'Lord, let me land a blessed landing. You are the Best of harborers'","2703":"Surely, in that are signs, and surely We will put (nations) to the test.","2704":"Then We produced after them another generation","2705":"and We sent to them a Messenger from themselves, saying: 'Worship Allah, for you have no god except He. Will you not be cautious'","2706":"The unbelieving assembly of his nation, who belied the encounter of the Everlasting Life, and on whom We had bestowed ease in this life, said: 'This is but a human like yourselves; he eats of what you eat and drinks of what you drink.","2707":"If you obey a mortal like yourselves, you shall be lost.","2708":"What, does he promise you that when you are dead and turned to dust and bones, you will be brought forth?","2709":"After, after with that which you are promised!","2710":"There is nothing but our present life; we die, and we live, and we shall not be resurrected.","2711":"He is nothing but a man who has forged against Allah a lie, we will never believe him'","2712":"He said: 'Help me, Lord, they belie me'","2713":"He replied: 'Before long, by the morning, they shall be remorseful'","2714":"And the Cry seized them in justice and We made them withered. So begone with the harmdoing nation.","2715":"After them We produced other generations","2716":"no nation outstrips its term, nor do they put it back.","2717":"Then We sent Our Messengers in succession. Yet whenever its Messenger came to a nation they belied him, so We made them follow others, and We made them but as tales, so begone the nation who did not believe!","2718":"Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs and clear authority","2719":"to Pharaoh and his Council, but they were very proud, and they were a tyrannical nation.","2720":"'What' they said, 'are we to believe in two mortals like us, whose nation are our worshipers'","2721":"So they belied them, and they were among the destroyed.","2722":"And We gave Moses the Book, in order that they might be guided.","2723":"We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign, and gave them a refuge on a hillside where there was a hollow and a spring.","2724":"Messengers! Eat of that which is good and do good deeds; I have knowledge of the things you do.","2725":"Your nation is but one nation, and I am your Lord, therefore fear Me.","2726":"Yet they have split their affairs between themselves into sects, each rejoicing in what it has.","2727":"Leave them in their perplexity for a time.","2728":"Do they think that in giving them wealth and children","2729":"We hasten in good works for them? No, they are not aware.","2730":"Those who tremble in fear of their Lord,","2731":"who believe in the verses of their Lord;","2732":"who associate none with their Lord,","2733":"who give what they give, with their hearts quaking, that they will return to their Lord:","2734":"those, hasten in good works, outracing to them.","2735":"We charge no soul with more than it can bear. We have a Book with Us which speaks the truth, and they shall not be wronged.","2736":"But their hearts are in ignorance of this (Koran); and they have deeds besides that which they are doing.","2737":"But when We seize with the punishment those of them that live in ease, they groan.","2738":"(We shall say): 'Do not groan today, surely you shall receive no help from Us'","2739":"My verses were recited to you, but you turned upon your heels,","2740":"being proud against it, talking foolishness by night.","2741":"Should they not think upon the saying? Or, did anything come upon them that had not come upon their ancient forefathers?","2742":"Or, is it because they do not recognize their Messenger that they denied him?","2743":"Do they say he is mad! No, he came to them with the truth, but most of them hate the truth.","2744":"Had the truth followed their fancies, the heavens, the earth, and all who live in them would have surely been corrupted. No, We brought them theirRemembrance; but from their Remembrance they turn away.","2745":"Or, do you ask a tribute from them? Your Lord's tribute is better. He is the Best of providers.","2746":"Indeed you are calling them to a Straight Path,","2747":"but those who disbelieve in the Everlasting Life deviate from the Path.","2748":"If We had mercy on them and removed their afflictions, they would still persist in their insolence, blindly wandering.","2749":"Already We have seized them with the punishment, but they neither humbled themselves to their Lord, nor did they beseech Him,","2750":"when We opened on them a gate of severe punishment, they utterly despaired.","2751":"It was He who produced for you hearing, eyes, and hearts, yet little is that you thank.","2752":"It was He who scattered you on the earth, and before Him you shall be gathered.","2753":"It is He who revives and makes to die, and to Him belong the alternation of the night and the day. Will you not understand!","2754":"No, but they said what the ancients said before them:","2755":"'When we are dead and become dust and bones shall we be resurrected?","2756":"We and our fathers have been promised this before. It is but of the ancients' fictitious tales'","2757":"Say: \"If you have knowledge, 'to whom belongs the earth' and, 'whoever is in it?

It is only a word which he will speak. Behind them there shall stand a barrier till the Day that they shall be resurrected.","2774":"And when the Horn is blown, on that Day their ties of kindred shall be no more, nor will they ask each other.","2775":"Those whose scales are heavy shall prosper,","2776":"but those whose scales are light shall forfeit their souls and live in Gehenna (Hell) for ever.","2777":"The fire lashes their faces and therein are shriveled lips.","2778":"(We shall say): 'Were My verses not recited to you, and did you not belie them'","2779":"'Lord' they will reply, 'adversity prevailed over us and we were erring.","2780":"Our Lord, bring us out of it. If we return (to sin), then we shall indeed be harmdoers'","2781":"He will say: 'Slink there in it and do not speak to Me'","2782":"Among My worshipers there were a party who said: \"Lord, we believed. Forgive us and have mercy on us: You are the Best of the merciful.\"","2783":"But you took them for laughingstock, mocking at them, until they caused you to forget My remembrance.","2784":"Today I shall recompense them for their patience, for it is they that have won.","2785":"And He will ask: 'How many years did you live on earth'","2786":"They will reply: 'A day, or part of a day; ask those who have kept count'","2787":"He will say: 'You have tarried a little, did you know?","2788":"Did you think that We had created you only for play, and that you would never be returned to Us'","2789":"High Exalted be Allah, the King, the Truth. There is no god except He, the Lord of the Noble Throne.","2790":"Whosoever calls upon another god, other than Allah, having no proof his reckoning will be with his Lord. The unbelievers shall never prosper.","2791":"And say: 'My Lord, forgive and have mercy, for You are the Best of the merciful'","2792":"This is a chapter which We have sent down and appointed; and in it We have sent down clear verses in order that you will remember.","2793":"You shall lash the fornicatress and the fornicator each with a hundred lashes. In the religion of Allah, let no tenderness for them seize you if you believe in Allah and the Last Day; and let their punishment be witnessed by a party of believers.","2794":"The fornicator shall marry none but a fornicatress or an idolatress; and the fornicatress none shall marry her but a fornicator or an idolater; that is forbidden to the believers.","2795":"Those who accuse chaste women, and cannot produce four witnesses, you shall lash them with eighty lashes. And never accept their testimony, for they are evildoers,","2796":"except those among them that afterwards repent and mend their ways. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.","2797":"And those who accuse their wives and have no witnesses except themselves, let them testify by swearing by Allah four times that he is of the truthful,","2798":"and the fifth time, that the curse of Allah shall be upon him, if he should be of the liars.","2799":"But the punishment will be averted from her if she swears four times that he is of the liars,","2800":"and on the fifth time the Wrath of Allah shall be upon her if he is of the truthful.","2801":"If it were not for the bounty of Allah to you and His Mercy, and that Allah turns, and is the Wise,","2802":"those who came with the slander were a number of you. Do not regard it evil for you, rather it is good for you. Every person of them shall have the sin that he has earned charged to him. As for he who took upon himself the greater part there is a mightier punishment.","2803":"Had you heard it, and the believing men and women, thought good thoughts about one another said: 'This is a clear falsehood'","2804":"Why, did they not bring four witnesses against it? But since they did not bring the witnesses, before Allah they are the liars.","2805":"But for the bounty of Allah and His Mercy towards you in this life and in the Everlasting Life you would have been sternly punished for that which you were involved.","2806":"You carried with your tongues and uttered with your mouths what you did not know. You have thought it a trifle, but before Allah it was a mighty thing.","2807":"When you heard it, why did you not say: 'It is not right for us to speak of this. Exaltations to You! This is a mighty slander'","2808":"Allah exhorts you never again to repeat the like, if you are believers.","2809":"Allah makes plain to you His verses, and Allah is the Knower, the Wise.","2810":"Those who love that indecency should be broadcast about those who believe theirs is a painful punishment in this world and in the Everlasting Life. Allah knows, and you do not know.","2811":"If it was not for the bounty of Allah to you and His Mercy, and Allah is the Gentle, the Most Merciful.","2812":"Believers, do not follow in the steps of satan, for those who follow the steps of satan, he bids to indecency and dishonor. But for the bounty of Allah to you, and His Mercy no one of you would ever have been purified; but Allah purifies whom He will; Allah is the Hearer, the Knower.","2813":"Do not let those of you who possess bounty and plenty swear not to give kinsmen, and the poor, and those who emigrate in the way of Allah. Let them pardon and forgive. Do you not yearn that Allah forgives you? And Allah is the Forgiver, the Most Merciful.","2814":"Surely, those who defame chaste, unsuspecting, believing women, shall be cursed in this world and in the Everlasting Life, and for them there is a mightypunishment.","2815":"On the Day when their tongues, hands and feet shall testify against them concerning what they were doing.","2816":"Upon that Day Allah will pay them their due in full, and they will know that Allah is the clear truth.","2817":"Evil women for evil men, and evil men for evil women; good women for good men, and good men for good women these are clear of what has been said; for them is forgiveness, and a generous provision.","2818":"Believers, do not enter houses other than your houses until you first ask permission and greet with peace the people thereof; that is better for you in order that you remember.","2819":"And if you do not find anyone there, do not enter it until permission is given to you. And if you are told 'Return', so return, that is purer for you; and Allah knows the things you do.","2820":"There is no fault in you that you enter uninhabited houses wherein there is benefit for you. Allah knows what you reveal and what you hide.","2821":"Say to the believers they should lower their gaze and guard their private parts that is purer for them. Allah is Aware of the things they do.","2822":"And say to the believing women, that they lower their gaze cast down their eyes and guard their chastity, and do not reveal their adornment except that which is outward (face and hands); and let them draw their veils over their neck, and not reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husbands' fathers, or their sons, or their husbands' sons, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or what their right hands own, or such male attendants having no sexual desire, or children who have not yet attained knowledge of women's private parts; nor let them stamp their feet, so that their hidden ornament is known. And, O believers turn to Allah all together, in order that you prosper.","2823":"Marry those among you who are spouseless and the virtuous among your male and female slaves (thereby freeing them), if they are poor, Allah will enrichthem of His bounty; Allah is Embracing, Knowing.","2824":"Let those who do not find the means to marry be abstinent until Allah enriches them of His bounty. Those your right hand owns who seek their freedom, make a contract with them accordingly if you know some good in them, and give them from the wealth of Allah that He has given you. Do not force your slavegirls into prostitution in order to seek worldly gain for they wish to preserve their chastity. Whosoever compels them, surely Allah, after their being compelled, is the Forgiver (to the girls), the Most Merciful.","2825":"Now We have sent down to you clarifying verses, and an example of those who passed away before you and admonition to the cautious.","2826":"Allah is the Lighter of the heavens and the earth. The example of His Light is like a tube, in which there is a wick. The wick is in a lamp and the lamp is as a glittering planet kindled from a Blessed Tree, an olive that is neither of the East nor of the West. Its oil would almost shine forth though no fire touched it. Light upon light; Allah guides to His Light whom He will. Allah strikes parables for people. Allah has knowledge of all things.","2827":"In houses which Allah has allowed to be raised up, and His Name to be remembered therein. In the morning and evening","2828":"are men who exalt Him there, whom neither trade nor sale can divert from the remembrance of Allah, and establish the prayers, and pay the obligatorycharity; fearing a Day when hearts and eyes shall be turned about,","2829":"that Allah will recompense them for the finest deeds they did and increase them from His bounty. Allah provides without measure to whom He will.","2830":"As for the unbelievers, their works are like a mirage in the wilderness. The thirsty person thinks it is water, but when he comes near he finds that it is nothing. He finds Allah there, who pays him his account in full. Allah is Swift in reckoning.","2831":"Or, they are like darkness upon a deep sea covered with a wave above which is another wave, above which are clouds, darkness piled one upon the other; when he stretches out his hand he can scarcely see it. Indeed, to whomsoever Allah assigns no light, he shall have no light.","2832":"Have you not seen how Allah is exalted by those in the heavens and earth, and the birds with outspread wings? He knows its prayers and its exaltations and Allah has knowledge of the things they do.","2833":"To Allah belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth. To Him is the arrival.","2834":"Have you not seen how Allah drives the clouds, then gathers them and converts them into a mass, then you see rain coming from the midst of them? And He sends down out of heaven mountains in which there is hail, pelting with it whom He will, and turning it away from whom He will. The flash of its lightning almost snatches away the sight.","2835":"Allah turns about the night and the day (to succeed one another); surely, in this there is a lesson for those who have eyes.","2836":"Allah created everything that walks from water. Some creep upon their bellies, others walk on two feet, and others walk on four. Allah creates whatever He will. Allah is Powerful over everything.","2837":"We have sent down clarifying verses. Allah guides whom He will to a Straight Path.","2838":"They say: 'We believe in Allah and the Messenger and obey' But a party of them turn away after this. Those are not believers.","2839":"And when they are called to Allah and His Messenger so that he judges between them, a party of them swerve away.","2840":"If the right is theirs, they would have hastened to him obediently.","2841":"Is there a sickness in their hearts, or, are they in doubt? Do they fear that Allah and His Messenger will be unjust? No, but those they are the harmdoers.","2842":"But when the believers are called to Allah and His Messenger, in order that he judges between them, their reply is: 'We hear and obey' Such are theprosperous.","2843":"Those who obey Allah and His Messenger, and fear Allah, and have awe of Him, shall be the winners.","2844":"They swear by Allah in the most earnest oaths, that if you order them, they would go forth. Say: 'Do not swear, known obedience (is better). Allah is Aware of the things you do'","2845":"Say: 'Obey Allah and obey the Messenger. If you turn away, upon him only rests what is laid upon him, and upon you rests what is laid on you. If you obey him, you shall be guided. It is only for the Messenger to deliver a clear message'","2846":"Allah has promised those of you who believe and do good works that He will indeed make them successors in the land as He made those who were before them successors, and that He will indeed establish their religion for them; that which He has approved for them, and will exchange safety for them after their fear. They worship Me and associate nothing with Me. After that, those who disbelieve are the impious.","2847":"Establish the prayers, pay the charity, and obey the Messenger, in order to have mercy.","2848":"Never think that the unbelievers will be able to frustrate (Us) in the earth. Their refuge is the Fire, an evil arrival.","2849":"Believers, let those your right hand owns and those who have not come of age ask permission of you three times before the dawn prayer, when you put aside your garments, in the heat of noon, and after the night prayer. These are the three occasions of privacy. There is no fault in you or them, apart from these, that they go about you, you are of each other. As such Allah makes plain to you His verses, Allah is the Knower, the Wise.","2850":"And when children reach the age of puberty, let them ask permission as those before them asked permission. As such Allah makes clear to you His verses. Allah is the Knower, the Wise.","2851":"(As for) women that are past childbearing who have no hope of marriage there is no fault in them that they discard their cloaks provided they do not reveal their adornments, but it is better if they abstain. Allah is the Hearer, the Knower.","2852":"It shall be no fault for the blind, the lame, the sick and yourselves to eat from your houses. Nor the houses of your fathers', your mothers', your brothers', your sisters', your paternal uncles, your paternal aunts, your maternal uncles, your maternal aunts or in houses the keys of which you own, or in those of your friend, there is no fault in you that you all eat together, or separately. When you enter houses, greet (with peace) one another with a salutation from Allah, blessed and good. As such Allah makes clear to you His verses so that you understand.","2853":"The believers are only those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, and who, when gathered with him upon a common matter do not depart till they have asked his permission. Surely, those who ask your permission are those who believe in Allah and His Messenger. When they ask your permission for some of their affairs, grant it to whomever you please and ask Allah for forgiveness for them; Allah is the Forgiver, the Merciful.","2854":"Do not make the calling of the Messenger among yourselves like your calling to one another. Allah knows those of you who slip away surreptitiously, so let those who disobey His command beware, lest they are struck by sedition, or, they are stricken with a painful punishment.","2855":"To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. He has Knowledge of what state you are upon. On the Day when they shall be returned to Him, He will tell them all what they have done. And Allah has knowledge of everything.","2856":"Blessed is He who has sent down the Criterion to His worshiper (Prophet Muhammad), that he is a warner to all mankind;","2857":"to whom the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs, who has not taken a son, nor does He have an associate in the Kingdom, and He created everything, then He ordained it very precisely.","2858":"Yet they worship, other than Him, gods which cannot create anything and were themselves created. They own neither harm nor benefit for themselves, neither do they own death nor life, nor a resurrection.","2859":"The unbelievers say: 'This is but a falsehood he has forged? another nation has helped him' So they have come with wrong and falsehood.","2860":"They say: 'He has written tales of the ancients, they are recited to him at dawn and at the evening'","2861":"Say: 'It was sent down by Him who knows the secrets of heavens and earth. He is Forgiving, the Most Merciful.","2862":"They also say: 'How is it that this Messenger eats food and walks about the markets? Why has no angel been sent down with him to warn us?","2863":"Or, why has no treasure been thrown to him, or a garden for him to eat from' And the harmdoers say: 'The man you follow is surely bewitched'","2864":"See how they strike examples for you, surely they have gone astray and are unable to find a way.","2865":"Blessed be He who, if He wills, can assign you better things than these; gardens underneath which rivers flow, and He shall assign for you palaces.","2866":"No, they belied the Hour. We have prepared for him who belied the Hour a Blaze.","2867":"When it sees them from a far off place, they shall hear it raging and sighing.","2868":"And when, chained in (iron) fetters, they are cast into some narrow space of the Fire, they will call out for destruction.","2869":"'Do not call out today for one destruction; call out for many destructions'","2870":"Say: 'Is that better, or the Garden of Eternity which the cautious have been promised? It is their recompense and their arrival'","2871":"Living there for ever, they shall find in it all that they desire. That is a promise binding upon your Lord, and to be asked of Him.","2872":"On the Day when He gathers them with all that they worship, other than Allah, He will say: 'Was it you who misled My worshipers, or did they themselves go astray'","2873":"They will answer: 'Exaltations to You. We should not have taken others for a guardian, but You gave them and their fathers enjoyment until they forgot Your Remembrance and they were a destroyed nation'","2874":"So they belie what you say, and you can neither turn it aside, nor find any help. Those of you who have done evil, We let them taste a great punishment.","2875":"We did not send Messengers before you but that they ate food and walked about in the markets, We have appointed some of you to be a trial for others. Will you endure? Your Lord is the Seer.","2876":"Those who do not hope to meet Us ask: 'Why have no angels been sent to us? Why can we not see our Lord' How proud they are within themselves, and have become greatly disdainful.","2877":"On the Day when they behold the angels, there will be no glad tidings for the sinners. They will say: 'A refuge which is forbidden'","2878":"Then We shall advance upon the work which they have done and render it as scattered dust.","2879":"On that Day, the companions of Paradise (will have) a better abode and a finer restingplace.","2880":"On that Day, the heaven is split asunder with clouds and the angels are sent down in majesty,","2881":"the true Kingdom on that Day shall belong to the Merciful a harsh day for the unbelievers.","2882":"Upon that Day the harmdoer shall bite his hands, and say: 'Would that I had taken a Path with the Messenger!","2883":"Would that I had never chosen soandso for my companion!","2884":"He led me astray from the Remembrance after it had reached me, satan is ever the foresaker of humans'","2885":"The Messenger says: 'O my Lord, my people have taken this Koran while deserting it'","2886":"To every Prophet We have appointed an enemy among the harmdoers; your Lord is Sufficient for you, a Guide and a Helper.","2887":"The unbelievers ask: 'Why was the Koran not sent down to him all at once' As such We strengthen your heart thereby, and We have recited it very distinctly.","2888":"They do not bring to you any parable but that which We bring to you is the truth and better in explanation.","2889":"Those who will be gathered into Gehenna (Hell) upon their faces shall be in the worst in place, and have gone further astray from the Path.","2890":"We gave the Book to Moses and gave him his brother Aaron as a minister.","2891":"(Then) We said: 'Go to the nation who have belied Our signs' And We utterly destroyed them.","2892":"The nation of Noah, We drowned them when they belied their Messenger, and made of them a sign to the nation. For the harmdoers We have prepared a painful punishment","2893":"also to Aad and Thamood and the nation of ErRass and many generations in between;","2894":"to each of them We gave examples, and each of them We utterly ruined.","2895":"They have surely passed by the village which was rained upon by evil rain (of stones); what, have they never seen it? No, they look for no resurrection.","2896":"Whenever they see you, they mock you (saying): 'Is this whom Allah has sent as a Messenger?","2897":"He would have mislead us from our gods, if we had not been steadfast to them' But they shall know who is further astray from the Path when they see the punishment.","2898":"Have you seen him who has made gods of his own desires? Would you be a guardian over him?","2899":"Do you think that most of them can hear or understand? They are like cattle, no, they are further astray from the Path.","2900":"Do you not see how your Lord stretches the shadow? Had it been His will, He could have made it constant. Then He appointed the sun to be a guide to it;","2901":"thereafter We seize it to Us withdrawing it gently.","2902":"It is He who has appointed the night a mantle for you and sleep for a rest. The day He has appointed for rising.","2903":"It is He who loosens the winds, bearing glad tidings before the Hands of His Mercy, and We have sent down pure water from the heaven,","2904":"so, that with it We revive dead lands and provide drink for the cattle and the human We created.","2905":"We have indeed turned it about them, so that they remember; yet most people refuse all except disbelief.","2906":"Had it been Our will, We could have raised a warner in every village.","2907":"So do not obey the unbelievers, but struggle mightily with it (the Koran).","2908":"It was He who let forth the two seas, this one is palatably sweet and this salt, a bitter taste, and He set a barrier between them, and a refuge which is forbidden.","2909":"And it is He who created the human from water and gave him kindred of blood and of marriage. Your Lord is the Powerful.","2910":"Yet they (the unbelievers) worship, other than Allah, that which can neither benefit nor harm them. Surely, the unbeliever is ever a partisan against his Lord.","2911":"We did not send you but as a bearer of glad tidings and as a warner.","2912":"Say: 'I demand of you no wage for this except for he who wishes to take the Path to his Lord'","2913":"Put your trust in the All Living who never dies, and exalt with His praise, He is sufficiently aware of His worshipers' sins.","2914":"(It is) He who, in six days created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, and then He willed to the Throne. The Merciful; ask about Him from he who knows Him.","2915":"When it is said to them: 'Prostrate yourselves before the Merciful', they ask: 'And what is the Merciful? Shall we prostrate ourselves to whatever you bid us' And it increases their aversion.","2916":"Blessed be He who has set the constellations in the heaven, and set amongst them a sun, and an illuminating moon.","2917":"It is He who has made the night and day follow each other for those whom He desires to remember or He desires to be thankful.","2918":"The worshipers of the Merciful are those who walk humbly on the earth, and when the ignorant address them say: 'Peace'","2919":"who pass the night prostrating and standing to their Lord.","2920":"Who say: 'Our Lord, turn from us the punishment of Gehenna, for its punishment is the most terrible;","2921":"it is an evil settling, and an evil residence'","2922":"who when they spend are neither wasteful nor miserly, between that is a just stand,","2923":"who do not call upon another god with Allah, nor slay the soul which Allah has forbidden except by right; who do not fornicate, for he who does this shall face punishment","2924":"doubled for him on the Day of Resurrection is his punishment, and therein he shall live, humbled,","2925":"except he who repents and believes and does good works those, Allah will change their evil deeds into good deeds; Allah is ever Forgiving and Merciful.","2926":"He who repents and does good works truly turns to Allah in repentance,","2927":"and those who do not bear false witness, and when they pass by idle talk, pass by with honor","2928":"and who when they are reminded of the verses of their Lord, they do not fall down deaf and blind.","2929":"Those who say: 'Lord give us of our wives and children what pleases our eyes and make us leaders to the fearful'","2930":"Those shall be recompensed with the highest rank for their patience. There they shall receive a greeting, and peace!","2931":"There they shall live for ever; a fine dwelling place, and residence.","2932":"Say: 'My Lord cares little for you if it was not for your supplication, indeed you have belied (the Messenger and the Koran) so it (the punishment) will be fastened'","2933":"TaSeenMeem.","2934":"Those are the verses of the clear Book.","2935":"Perhaps you consume yourself that they are not believers.","2936":"If We will, We can send down on them a sign from heaven before which their necks will remain humbled.","2937":"A fresh remembrance has never come to them from the Merciful, except they turn away from it.","2938":"So, they belied, but surely the tidings of that they mocked will come to them.","2939":"Have they not seen the earth, how many We caused to grow in it every generous kind?","2940":"Surely, in this there is a sign yet most of them do not believe.","2941":"Your Lord, He is the Almighty, the Most Merciful.","2942":"And when your Lord called to Moses, saying: 'Go to the harmdoing nation,","2943":"the nation of Pharaoh.

If you complete ten that is of your own accord; I shall not press you. Surely, you will find me, if Allah wills, among the good'","3280":"'So be it between me and you' said Moses. 'Whichever of the two terms I fulfill, it will be no injustice to me. Allah is the Guardian of what we say'","3281":"And when Moses had fulfilled the term and departed with his household, he saw from far away on the side of the Tor a fire. He said to his household: 'Stay here, for I can see a fire. Perhaps I can bring you news, or a flame from the fire so that you can warm yourselves'","3282":"When he came to it, he was called from the right bank in the blessed plot of the tree (he heard speech without letter or voice coming from all directions):'Moses, I am Allah, Lord of the Worlds.","3283":"Cast down your staff' And when he saw his staff writhing as though it were a serpent, he turned about in retreat, and did not turn back. 'O Moses, approach and have no fear. You are surely safe.","3284":"Put your hand in the neck (of your shirt), it will come out luminous, unharmed, and draw your arm to you so that you are not afraid. These are two signs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his Assembly. Surely, they were an impious nation.'","3285":"'My Lord' (said Moses), 'I have killed a living soul among them, and fear that they will slay me.","3286":"Aaron my brother has a more eloquent tongue than I, (please) send him with me as a helper to confirm I speak truly, I fear that they will belie me'","3287":"He said: 'We will strengthen your arm with your brother, and appoint for you both an authority so that they shall not reach you. With our signs you and those who follow you shall be the victors.","3288":"And when Moses came to them with Our clear signs, they said: 'This is nothing but forged sorcery. We have never heard of this among our fathers, the ancients.'","3289":"Moses replied: 'My Lord knows well who brings guidance from Him and who shall possess the Last Residence. The harmdoers will not prosper'","3290":"'Assembly' said Pharaoh, 'I do not know that you have any god except me' 'O Haman, kindle a fire upon clay and make me a tower so that I can climb to see the God of Moses, I think that he is one of the liars'","3291":"He and his hosts became wrongfully proud in the land and they thought that they would never be returned to Us.","3292":"Therefore, We seized him and his hosts, and cast them into the sea. See how was the end of the harmdoers.","3293":"We made them leaders inviting to the Fire, and on the Day of Resurrection they shall not be victors.","3294":"In this world We laid Our curse on them, and on the Day of Resurrection they shall be among the exiled.","3295":"And We gave Moses the Book, after We had destroyed the former generations, to be reflections for people and a guidance, and a mercy in order that they might remember.","3296":"(Prophet Muhammad) you were not on the western side (of the mountain) when We decreed the commandment to Moses, nor were you among thosewitnessing.","3297":"We raised generations who lived long. You did not live among the people of Midian, nor did you recite to them Our verses; but We were sendingMessengers.","3298":"You were not present on the side of the Tor when We called. Yet as a mercy from your Lord to warn a nation to whom no warner has been sent before, in order that they remember","3299":"and not say, when evil befalls them on account of that which their hands forwarded: 'Our Lord, why did You not send a Messenger to us so that we might follow Your verses and so that we might be among the believers'","3300":"So when the truth (Prophet Muhammad) came to them from Us, they said: 'Why is he not given the like of that which was given to Moses' But did they not also disbelieve in that which Moses was given before! They say (about Moses and Aaron): 'Two sorcerers supporting one another' And they said: 'We disbelieve both'","3301":"Say: 'If what you say is true, bring down from Allah a Book that is a better guidance than both, I will follow it'","3302":"If they do not answer you, know that they are only following their desires. And who is further astray than he who is led by his desires without guidance fromAllah! Allah does not guide the harmdoers.","3303":"We have brought them the Word in order that they remember.","3304":"Those to whom We gave the Book before, believe in it.","3305":"When it is recited to them, they say: 'We believe in it, because it is the truth from Our Lord. We surrendered ourselves before it came.","3306":"'Their wage shall be given them twice, because they have endured patiently, averting evil with good and spending from what We have given them;","3307":"and because when they hear idle talk they turn away from it and say: 'We have our deeds, and you have your deeds. Peace be upon you. We do not desire the ignorant'","3308":"You cannot guide whom you please; it is Allah who guides whom He will. He knows well those who are guided.","3309":"They say: 'If we follow the guidance with you, we shall be driven from our land' But have We not given them a secure sanctuary from which fruits of every kind are collected as a provision from Us? Indeed, most of them do not know.","3310":"How many a village have We destroyed that were ungrateful in their life! Those are their dwellings, (they are) uninhabited after them except for a little; We are the inheritors.","3311":"Nor did your Lord destroy the villages until He had sent a Messenger to its mother village reciting to them Our verses. We never destroyed villages unless their inhabitants were harmdoers.","3312":"The things you have been given, and its adornments, are but the enjoyment of this present life. What is with Allah is better and everlasting. Do you not understand?","3313":"Is he to whom We promised a fine promise and receives it, like he who has been given the enjoyment of this present life, then on the Day of Resurrection shall be among those that are arraigned?","3314":"On that Day He will call to them, saying: 'Where are those whom you alleged to be My associates'","3315":"Those against whom the Word is realized shall say: 'Our Lord, those whom we led astray, we led them astray even as we ourselves were astray. We are quit of them to You; it was not us that they worshipped'","3316":"It will be said to them: 'Call on your associates' And they will call on them, but they will not respond to them, and they shall see the punishment if only they had been guided.","3317":"On that Day He will call to them and He will say: 'What response did you give Our Messengers'","3318":"And on that Day the news will be blinded for them, and they will not ask each other.","3319":"But, as for he who repents and believes, and does good deeds, he will be among those who prosper.","3320":"Your Lord creates whosoever He will and He chooses the choice was not theirs (the unbelievers). Exalted is Allah, above that they associate!","3321":"Your Lord knows what their chests hide and what they reveal.","3322":"And He is Allah; there is no god except He. The Praise is His in the former as in the latter. His is the Judgement, to Him you shall be returned.","3323":"Say: 'Think! What if Allah should enshroud you in unceasing night till the Day of Resurrection, what god, other than Allah, shall bring you light! Will you not hear?'","3324":"Say: 'What would you think if Allah should make the day unceasing over you till the Day of Resurrection, what god, other than Allah, shall bring you the night to sleep in. Will you not see'","3325":"In His Mercy He has appointed for you the night and the day, so that you can rest in it, and seek His bounty, in order that you will be thankful'","3326":"Upon that Day He will call to them saying: 'Now, where are those whom you alleged to be My associates'","3327":"From every nation We will bring a witness, and We shall say to them: 'Produce your proof' Then they shall know the truth is with Allah, and their own fabrications will forsake them.","3328":". Korah was one of Moses' nation. But he was insolent to them, for We had given him such treasures that their very keys were too heavy a burden for even the strong. His people said to him: 'Do not exult; Allah does not love the boastful.","3329":"But seek, in that which Allah has given you to attain the Everlasting residence. Do not forget your share in this world. Do good, as Allah has been good to you, and do not corrupt in the land, Allah does not love those who corrupt.","3330":"But he replied: 'What was given me is only because of the knowledge I possess' Did he not know that from the generations before him Allah had destroyed a mightier and more numerous in multitude? The sinners shall not be questioned about their sins.","3331":"So he went out in all his finery among his nation, those who desired this life said: 'Would that we had the like of that Korah has been given! He has indeed a mighty fortune'","3332":"But those to whom knowledge had been given said: 'Alas for you! Better is the reward of Allah for him who believes and does good works; but none shall receive it except the patient'","3333":"We caused the earth to swallow him, together with his dwelling, and there was no host to help him, other than Allah; and he was not amongst the victorious.","3334":"And in the morning those who had wished to be in his place the previous evening said: 'Indeed, Allah outspreads to whom He will among His worshipers, and He restrains. Had He not shown us favor, He could have caused the earth to swallow us. Indeed, the unbelievers shall never prosper'","3335":"That is the Last Abode, We shall assign it to those who desire neither exorbitance in the earth, nor corruption. The outcome is for the cautious.","3336":"Whosoever does a good deed shall have better than it. But whosoever does evil deeds, they shall be recompensed for what they were doing.","3337":"He who has obligated the Koran will bring you to an appointment. Say: 'My Lord knows well who comes with guidance, and who is in clear error'","3338":"You did not hope that the Book would be given to you except as mercy from your Lord. So do not be a supporter of the unbelievers.","3339":"Let no one bar you from the verses of Allah after they have been sent down to you, but call to your Lord, and do not be amongst the idolaters.","3340":"And do not call upon another god with Allah, there is no god except He. All things perish, except His Face, Judgement is His, and to Him all of you shall return.","3341":"AlifLaamMeem.","3342":"Do people think that they are left alone by saying: 'We are believers' and will not be tried?","3343":"We tried those who have gone before them. Allah knows those who are truthful and those who lie.","3344":"Or do the evildoers think that they will outstrip Us? How evil is their judgment!","3345":"He who hopes to meet Allah (must know) that the term of Allah is coming. He is the Hearer, the Knower.","3346":"He who strives, strives for himself. Allah is the Rich, independent of the worlds.","3347":"As for those who believe and do good works, We shall acquit them of their sins, and recompense them with the best for what they were doing.","3348":"We have charged the human to be kind to his parents. But if they bid you to associate with Me that which you have no knowledge, do not obey them. To Me you will return, and I shall inform you of all that you have done.","3349":"Those who believe and do good works shall be admitted among the righteous.","3350":"There are some people who say: 'We believe in Allah' yet when such is hurt in the cause of Allah, he makes the persecution of people as though it were the punishment of Allah. But then if help comes from his Lord, he will say: 'We were with you' Does Allah not know what is in the (people's) chests of the worlds?","3351":"Most certainly Allah knows the believers and the hypocrites.","3352":"The unbelievers say to those who believe: 'Follow our path, and we will carry your sins' Yet they cannot carry even a thing of their sins. They are surely lying.","3353":"They shall certainly carry their loads, and other loads besides their loads, and on the Day of Resurrection, they shall be questioned about what they forged.","3354":"Indeed, We sent Noah to his nation, and he lived amongst them for a thousand years, less fifty (but they belied him), then the Flood seized them while they were harmdoers.","3355":"But We saved him and all who were in the Ark, and made (the event) a sign to the worlds.","3356":"And (remember) Abraham.

Those whom you worship, other than Allah, have no power to give you provision. Therefore seek the provision of Allah, and worship Him. Give thanks to Him, to Him you shall return'","3358":"If you belie me, other nations before you also belied. It is only for a Messenger to deliver the clear deliverance.","3359":"Do they not see how Allah originates the Creation, and then brings it back? That is an easy matter for Allah.","3360":"Say: 'Travel in the land and see how He started the Creation. Then Allah will originate the Everlasting Life. Allah has power over all things.","3361":"He punishes whom He will and has mercy to whom He will. To Him you shall be turned.","3362":"You are not able to frustrate Him either in the earth or heaven, nor have you, other than Allah, a guardian or helper.","3363":"Those who disbelieve the verses of Allah and the meeting with Him shall despair of My Mercy, for them there awaits a painful punishment.","3364":"The only answer his nation gave was that they said: 'Kill him, or burn him!

On some We loosed a squall of pebbles, and others were seized by the Cry. Some We caused to be swallowed up by the earth, and some We drowned. Allah would never wrong them but they wronged themselves.","3381":"The likeness of those who have taken guardians, other than Allah, is as the likeness of the spider that takes to itself a house; surely the spider's house is the weakest house if they but knew.","3382":"Allah knows whatever they call upon other than Him; He is the Almighty, the Wise.","3383":"And We strike these parables for the people, but none understands except the knowledgeable.","3384":"Allah has created the heavens and the earth with the truth. Surely, in that there is a sign for believers.","3385":"Recite what has been sent down to you of the Book, and establish the prayer. Prayer forbids indecency and dishonor. The remembrance of Allah is greater, and Allah knows what you do.","3386":"And do not dispute with the People of the Book (Nazarenes) except in the best manner, except for those among them who do wrong and say (to them): 'We believe in that which was sent down to us and that which was sent down to you.

Nor shall you make any to hear except those who believe in Our verses, and are submissive.","3463":"Allah creates you weak; after weakness He gives you strength and after strength weakness and gray hairs. He creates whatever He will. He is the Knower, the Capable.","3464":"Upon the Day when the Hour has come, the harmdoers will swear that they had stayed no more than an hour. As such they are deceived.","3465":"But those to whom knowledge and belief have been given will say: 'You have stayed in the Book of Allah (the Protected Tablets) till the Day of Resurrection. This is the Day of Resurrection, yet you did not know'","3466":"On that Day, excuses shall not benefit the harmdoers, nor shall they be asked to make amends.","3467":"In this Koran We have set forth for mankind all manner of examples. Yet if you bring to them a sign the unbelievers will surely say: 'You are but falsifiers'","3468":"As such Allah seals the hearts of those who do not know.","3469":"Therefore, have patience. The promise of Allah is true.

Then, We drive them on to a dead land and revive the earth after it's death. Such is the Raising Up.","3670":"He who wants might, the Might belongs to Allah altogether. To Him ascend good words, and the righteous deed He raises. But those who devise evil deeds theirs shall be a terrible punishment, and their plotting shall be annulled.","3671":"Allah created you from dust, then from a (sperm) drop. Then he made you pairs. No female conceives or is delivered except by His Knowledge. He whose life is long, whatsoever is increased or decreased of his age is in a Clear Book. Surely, that is easy for Allah.","3672":"The two seas are not alike. One is fresh, sweet and pleasant to taste, while the other is salt and bitter. Yet, from each you eat fresh flesh and bring forth out of it ornaments for you to wear. And you see the ships plow their course through it so that you may seek His bounty, and in order that you give thanks.","3673":"He causes the night to enter into the day and the day into the night. He has subjected the sun and the moon each running for a named term. Such is Allah, your Lord. To Him belongs the Kingdom; and those whom you call upon, other than Him, do not possess even as much as the membrane of a datestone.","3674":"If you supplicate to them they cannot hear your supplication, and if they heard, they cannot answer you. On the Day of Resurrection they will disown your associating. None can tell you like He who is the Aware.","3675":"People, it is you who are in need of Allah. He is the Rich, the Praised.","3676":"He can put you away, if He will, and bring a new creation","3677":"this is not a great matter for Allah.","3678":"No laden soul shall bear another's load. If one is heavyburdened and calls for his load to be carried, nothing of it will be carried, not even if he is a close relative. You warn only those who fear their Lord in the Unseen, and establish the prayer. He who purifies himself, purifies himself for the good of his own soul. To Allah is the arrival.","3679":"The blind and the seeing are not equal,","3680":"nor are darkness and light.","3681":"The shade and the hot wind are not equal,","3682":"nor are the living and the dead equal. Allah makes to hear whosoever He will, but you cannot make those who are in their graves hear.","3683":"You (Prophet Muhammad) are but a warner.","3684":"We have sent you with the truth, a bearer of glad tidings and warning, for there is no nation, that has not had a warner pass away in it.","3685":"If they belie you, those before them also belied. Their Messengers came to them with clear signs; the Psalms, and the Illuminating Book.","3686":"Then I seized those who disbelieved, and how was My rejection!","3687":"Did you not see how Allah sends down water from the sky and with it brings forth different colored fruits? In the mountains there are paths of various colors, of white and red, and jetblack.","3688":"People too, and beasts and cattle have their different colors. But it is only those amongst His worshippers that fear Allah who have knowledge. Indeed, Allah is the Almighty and the Forgiving.","3689":"Indeed, those who recite the Book of Allah and establish their prayers and spend, in secret and in public of that which We have provided them, look for a trade that does not come to nothing,","3690":"so that He may pay them in full their wages and enrich them from His bounty. Surely, He is the Forgiver and the Thanker.","3691":"That which We have revealed to you of the Book is the truth and it confirms what was before it. Allah is Aware and sees His worshipers.","3692":"Then, We gave the Book as an inheritance to those of our worshipers whom We chose. Among them, is he who was harmful to himself, and some who minimize, and some who, by the permission of Allah, race in charity, this is the greatest virtue.","3693":"They shall enter the Gardens of Eden, where they shall be adorned with bracelets of gold and with pearls, and there, their robes shall be of silk.","3694":"They shall say: 'Praise belongs to Allah who has removed all sorrow from us. Indeed, our Lord is the Forgiver, the Thanker.","3695":"Through His bounty He has made us to live in the abode of Everlasting Life, where neither weariness nor fatigue shall touch us'","3696":"As for the unbelievers, theirs is the Fire of Gehenna. They shall neither be done away with nor die, and its punishment shall never be lightened for them. As such shall We recompense every unbeliever.","3697":"There they will cry out: 'Our Lord, bring us out, and we will do good, other than what we have done' What, did We not make your lives long enough to remember for whosoever would remember? A warner came to you, so taste now! None shall help the harmdoers.","3698":"Allah knows the Unseen in the heavens and earth. He knows that which is in the innermost of the chests.","3699":"It is He who made you caliphs in the earth. He who disbelieves, his disbelief shall be charged against him. The unbelievers disbelief does nothing for them, except, increase them in hate with Allah their disbelief increases the unbelievers only in loss.","3700":"Say: 'Have you considered your associates who you call upon, other than Allah? Show me what they have created in the earth! Or, have they a partnership in the heavens' Or, have We given them a Book so that they have proof of it? No, the harmdoers promise each other nothing else but delusion.","3701":"It is Allah who holds the heavens and the earth lest they vanish. Should they vanish, none would hold them after Him. He is the Clement, the Forgiving.","3702":"They solemnly swore by Allah that if a warner came to them they would be more rightly guided than any other of the nations. Yet, when a warner came to them, it only increased their aversion,","3703":"behaving arrogantly in the land and devising evil. But, evil devising coils only those who do it. Do they look except for the ways of former nations? You shall never find any change in the way of Allah.","3704":"What, have they not journeyed through the land and seen the end of those who went before them? They were stronger and mightier than themselves. Allah! There is nothing in heavens or earth that can frustrate Him, He is the Knower, the Able.","3705":"If Allah should take people to task for what they have earned, He would not leave one creature that crawls upon the face (of the earth)! But, He is deferring them to a named time. And when their time comes, indeed, Allah is the Seer of His worshipers.","3706":"YaSeen.","3707":"By the Wise Koran,","3708":"you (Prophet Muhammad) are truly among the Messengers sent","3709":"upon a Straight Path.","3710":"The sending down of the Mighty, the Most Merciful","3711":"so that you may warn a people whose fathers were not warned, and so were heedless.","3712":"The Phrase has become obligatory upon most of them, yet they do not believe.","3713":"We have bound their necks with fetters up to their chin, so that their heads are raised and cannot be lowered.","3714":"We have set a barrier before them and a barrier behind them, and, We have covered them so that they do not see.","3715":"It is the same whether you have warned them or you have not warned them, they do not believe.","3716":"You only warn he who follows the Remembrance and fears the Merciful in the Unseen. Give to him glad tidings of forgiveness and a generous wage.","3717":"Surely, it is We who revive the dead and write down what they have forwarded and what they have left behind; We have counted everything in a Clear Book.","3718":"Give to them a parable; to the people of the village there came Messengers,","3719":"We sent to them two, but they belied them so We reinforced them with a third. They said: 'We have surely been sent as Messengers to you'","3720":"But they said: 'You are only humans like ourselves. The Merciful has not sent down anything, your speech is but lies'","3721":"They said: 'Our Lord knows that we are Messengers to you.","3722":"And it is only for us to deliver a Clear Message'","3723":"They answered: 'We predict evil of you. If you do not desist, we will stone you and a painful punishment from us will befall you'","3724":"They said: 'Your prediction is with you, if you are reminded. Surely, you are but a wayward nation'","3725":"Then, a man came running from the furthest part of the village 'My nation' he said, 'follow the Messengers,","3726":"follow those who ask no wage of you and are rightly guided.","3727":"Why should I not worship Him who has originated me and to whom you shall all be returned?","3728":"What, shall I take, other than Him, gods whose intercession, if the Merciful desires to afflict me, cannot help me at all, and they will never save me?","3729":"Surely, I should then be in clear error.","3730":"I believe in your Lord, so hear me'","3731":"It was said (to him): 'Enter Paradise' and he said: 'Would that my people knew","3732":"that my Lord has forgiven me, and caused me to be amongst the receivers of generosity'","3733":"And We did not send down to his nation after him any army from heaven, neither would We send any down.","3734":"It was only one Shout and they were silent, still.","3735":"Woe, for those (unbelieving) worshipers! They mocked every Messenger that came to them.","3736":"Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them? They shall never return to them,","3737":"all shall be arraigned before Us.","3738":"The dead land is a sign for them. We revive it, and from it produce grain from which they eat.","3739":"And there We made gardens of palms and vines, and in it We caused fountains to gush forth,","3740":"so that they might eat of its fruit and the labor of their hands. Will they not give thanks?","3741":"Exaltations to Him who created pairs of all the things the earth produces and of themselves, and that of which they have no knowledge.","3742":"A sign for them is the night. From it We withdraw the day and they are in darkness.","3743":"The sun runs to its fixed restingplace; that is the decree of the Almighty, the Knower.","3744":"And the moon, We have determined it in phases till it returns like an old palmbranch.","3745":"The sun shall not outstrip the moon, nor shall the night outstrip the day. Each is floating in an orbit.","3746":"And a sign for them is that We carried their offspring in the laden Ark (of Noah).","3747":"And We have created for them the like of it in which they board.","3748":"We drown them if We will, then they have none to cry to, nor can they be saved,","3749":"except through Our Mercy and as enjoyment for awhile.","3750":"When it is said to them: 'Have fear of that which is before you and behind you in order that you find mercy'","3751":"Yet there never comes to them any sign of their Lord's signs, but they turn away from it.","3752":"And when it is said to them: 'Spend of that which Allah has given you' the unbelievers say to the believers: 'Are we to feed those whom Allah can feed if He chooses?

It is the way of Allah that has passed concerning His worshipers. There, the unbelievers shall be lost.","4219":"HaMeem.","4220":"A sending down from the Merciful, the Most Merciful.","4221":"A Book, the verses of which are distinguished, an Arabic Koran for a nation who know.","4222":"It bears glad tidings and a warning, yet most of them turn away and do not listen.","4223":"They say: 'Our hearts are veiled from that to which you call us, and in our ears there is heaviness. And between us and you is a veil. So work (as you will) and we are working'","4224":"Say (Prophet Muhammad): 'I am only a human like you, to whom it is revealed that your God is One God. Therefore be straight with Him and ask Him to forgive you. Woe to the idolaters,","4225":"who do not pay charity and disbelieve in the Everlasting Life.","4226":"For those who believe and do good works is an enduring wage'","4227":"Say: 'Do you disbelieve in Him who created the earth in two days? And do you set up equals with Him? He is the Lord of the Worlds'","4228":"He set firm mountains on top (of the earth) and He blessed it. And in four days He ordained in it many provisions, equal to those who ask.","4229":"Then He willed to the heaven when it was smoke, and to it and the earth He said: 'Come willingly, or unwillingly' 'We come willingly' they answered.","4230":"In two days He determined them seven heavens, and He revealed to each heaven its commands. We decorated the lowest heaven with lamps and preserve them. Such is the decree of the Almighty, the Knower.","4231":"But if they turn away, say: 'I have given you warning of a thunderbolt similar to that which overtook Aad and Thamood'","4232":"When their Messengers came to them from before them and behind them, (saying): 'Worship none except Allah' they answered: 'Had it been the will of our Lord, He would have sent down angels. So we disbelieve in the Message with which you were sent'","4233":"As for Aad, they behaved proudly in the earth without right. 'Who is stronger than us' they would say. Could they not see that Allah, who created them, is stronger than they? But they disbelieved Our signs.","4234":"Then, on the ominous days, We loosed against them a howling wind that We might let them taste the punishment of humiliation in this life; but more humiliating will be the punishment of the Everlasting Life and they will not be helped.","4235":"As for Thamood, We (offered) them Our Guidance, but they preferred blindness to guidance. So a thunderbolt of the humiliating punishment seized them because of what they had earned;","4236":"and We saved those who believed and feared Allah.","4237":"On the Day when the enemies of Allah will be rightfully gathered together before Fire,","4238":"when they reach it, their hearing, eyes and skins will testify against them for what they were doing.","4239":"'Why did you bear witness against us' they will ask their skins, and they will reply: 'Allah has given us speech, as He has given speech to everything. It was He who created you the first time, and to Him you shall return.","4240":"It is not that you covered yourselves so that your hearing, eyes and skin could not bear witness against you but you thought that Allah did not know much of that which you do.","4241":"Rather, it is the thoughts you thought about your Lord that have destroyed you, therefore, this morning you find yourselves among the losers'","4242":"Even if they are patient the Fire shall still be their lodging, and if they seek pardon, they shall not be among those who are pardoned.","4243":"We have assigned companions to them, who make what is before them and behind them seem fair to them. The statement has been realized against them in nations of people and jinn alike that passed away before them they were indeed the losers.","4244":"The unbelievers say: 'Do not listen to this Koran, and talk idly about it so that you might be overcome'","4245":"We will let the unbelievers taste a terrible punishment, and recompense them with the worst of what they were doing.","4246":"The Fire that is the recompense of the enemies of Allah. There it is that they will be lodged for eternity, a recompense for their disbelief of Our verses.","4247":"The unbelievers will say: 'Lord, show us the jinn and people who led us astray, to put them under our feet so that they are among the lowest'","4248":"The angels will descend on those who said: 'Allah is Our Lord' and have then gone straight, (saying:) 'Be neither fearful, nor sad; rejoice in the Paradise you have been promised.","4249":"We are your guides in this world and in the Everlasting Life. There, you shall have all that your souls desire, and all that you ask for","4250":"as hospitality from One, the Forgiving, the Most Merciful'","4251":"And, who is better in saying than he who invites to Allah, does what is right, and says: 'Surely, I am of those who surrender'","4252":"Good and evil deeds are not equal. Repel with that which is most just, and see, the one whom there is enmity between you will be as if he were a loyal guide.","4253":"But none will receive it except those who are patient and, none shall receive it, except he who has a great share.","4254":"If a provocation from satan should provoke you, seek refuge in Allah. He is the Hearer, the Knower.","4255":"Among His signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. But do not prostrate yourselves before the sun or the moon; rather prostrate before Allah, who created them both, if it is He whom you worship.","4256":"But if they become proud, those who are with your Lord exalt Him by day and night, and never grow weary.","4257":"And among His signs is that you see the earth humble; then when He sends down rain upon it, it quivers and swells. He who revives is He who revives the dead, surely, He is powerful over everything.","4258":"Those who disbelieve Our verses when it comes to them are not hidden from Us. Is he who is cast in the Fire better than he who comes in safety on the Day of Resurrection? Do as you will, surely, He sees the things you do.","4259":"Those who disbelieve in the Remembrance when it comes to them and indeed this is a Mighty Book","4260":"falsehood does not come to it from before it or from behind it. It is a sending down from the One, the Wise, the Praised.","4261":"Nothing that is said to you has not already been said to other Messengers before you. Indeed, your Lord is a Lord of forgiveness, but stern in retribution.","4262":"Had We made the Koran in a nonArabic (language) they would have said: 'If only its verses were distinguished! Why in (a) nonArabic (language, when theProphet is) an Arab' Say: 'To the believers it is a guidance and a healing. But to those who do not believe, there is a heaviness in their ears, to them it is blindness. They are those called from afar'","4263":"We gave the Book to Moses, but there were disputes about it, and had it not been for a Word that preceded from your Lord (their disputes) would have been decided between them. But they are in disquieting doubt about it.","4264":"He who does good does it for himself; and he who does evil does so against it. Your Lord never wrongs His worshipers.","4265":"To Him is referred the knowledge of the Hour. No fruit sprouts forth from its sheath, no female conceives or is delivered, except with His Knowledge. On the Day He will call to them: 'Where then are My associates' they will reply: 'We proclaim to You that none of us can bear witness'","4266":"Those they used to call upon before will go away from them, and they shall think that they have no asylum.","4267":"Mankind never wearies of supplicating for goodness, but when evil befalls him he is downcast and (grows) desperate.","4268":"And if We give him a taste of mercy from Us after his affliction has befallen him, he is sure to say: 'This is my own. I do not think the Hour will ever come. And even if I am returned to my Lord, with Him there is for me the finest reward (Paradise)' Then, We shall tell the unbelievers what they did and let them taste a harsh punishment.","4269":"When We favor a human, he swerves away and withdraws aside, but when evil befalls him he is full of unending prayer.","4270":"Say: 'Think, if this (Koran) is indeed from Allah, and you disbelieve in it, who is further astray than he who is in a wide schism'","4271":"We will show them Our signs in all the horizons and in themselves, until it is clear to them that it is the truth. Is it not sufficient that your Lord is witness over everything'","4272":"Are they not in doubt concerning the Meeting with their Lord? Attention, He encompasses everything.","4273":"HaMeem","4274":"'AeenSeenQaaf","4275":"As such Allah, the Almighty, the Wise reveals to you (Prophet Muhammad) and to those before you.","4276":"To Him belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth. He is the High, the Exalted.","4277":"The heavens nearly break apart above them as the angels exalt with the praise of their Lord and ask forgiveness for those on earth. Indeed Allah is the Forgiving, the Most Merciful.","4278":"As for those who take guardians for themselves, other than Him, Allah is the Warden over them. You are not a guardian over them.","4279":"As such We have revealed to you an Arabic Koran, so that you can warn the Mother of Villages (Mecca) and all who live about it, and that you also warn them of the Day of Gathering in which there is no doubt that a division will be in Paradise, and a division in the Blaze.","4280":"Had it been the Will of Allah, He would have made them all one nation. But He admits into His Mercy whom He will the harmdoers shall have neither a guardian nor helper.","4281":"Or have they taken to themselves guardians other than Him? But Allah, He is the Guardian. He revives the dead and has power over all things.","4282":"Whatever you differ upon, its judgement belongs to Allah. Such is Allah, my Lord, in Him I have put my trust, and to Him I turn in repentance.","4283":"The Originator of the heavens and the earth, He has given you from yourselves, pairs, and also pairs of cattle, thereby multiplying you. There is nothing like Him. He is the Hearer, the Seer.","4284":"To Him belongs the keys of the heavens and the earth. He outspreads and withholds His provisions to whom He will, surely, He has knowledge of all things.","4285":"He has made plain for you the Religion with which He charged Noah and that which We have revealed to you, and that with which We charged (Prophets) Abraham, Moses and Jesus, (saying): 'Establish the Religion and do not be divided therein' That which you invite them to is too overwhelming for the idolaters. Allah brings close to Himself whom He will, and guides to Him those who turn in repentance.","4286":"Yet they became divided only after knowledge had reached them from their own insolence. And had it not been for a Word that had preceded from yourLord, till an appointed term, it would have been determined between them. But those who inherited the Book after them are in disquieting doubt about it,","4287":"so invite and go straight as you are ordered, and do not follow their desires and say: 'I believe in whatever Book Allah has sent down. I am ordered to be just among you. Allah is our Lord and your Lord. We have our deeds and you have yours; there is no argument between us and you, Allah will bring us all together, to Him is the arrival'","4288":"As for those who argue concerning Allah after being answered, their arguments will be annulled before their Lord, and His Wrath will fall upon them, and for them there is a terrible punishment.","4289":"It is Allah who has sent down the Book in truth and the Scale. And what will let you know? The Hour is near.","4290":"Those who disbelieve in it seek to hasten it, but the believers are in fear of it, knowing it to be the truth. Indeed, those who doubt the Hour have strayed far away.","4291":"Allah is Subtle towards His worshipers, and provides for whosoever He will. He is the Strong, the Almighty.","4292":"Whoever hopes for the tillage of the Everlasting Life, We will increase his tillage; and whoever hopes for the tillage of this world, We give him some of it, but in the Everlasting Life he shall have no share.","4293":"Or do they have associates who have made lawful to them in religion what Allah has not permitted? Had it not been for the Decisive Word, it would have been decided between them. For the evildoers there is a painful punishment.","4294":"You shall see the harmdoers in fear of what they have earned as it is about to fall on them. But those who believe and do good deeds shall live in the meadows of the Gardens and from their Lord they will have all that they desire that is the great bounty.","4295":"This is the glad tidings that Allah gives to His worshipers, who believe and do good works. Say: 'For this I ask of you no wage except the love of the (Prophet's) relatives. We will add good to whosoever gains a good deed. Allah is the Forgiving and the Thanker'","4296":"Or do they say: 'He has forged a lie about Allah? But if Allah wills He could set a seal upon your heart. Allah wipes out falsehood and verifies the truth by His Words. He knows the innermost of the chests.","4297":"It is He who accepts the repentance of His worshipers and pardons their evil deeds. He has knowledge of what you do.","4298":"He answers those who believe and do good deeds, and He increases them from His bounty. But for the unbelievers there is a terrible punishment.","4299":"If Allah had expanded His provision to His worshipers, they would become tyrannical in the earth, but He sends down to them what He will in due measure; He is Aware and sees His worshipers.","4300":"It is He who sends down rain for them after they despaired, and He unfolds His Mercy. He is the Guardian, the Praised.","4301":"Among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the crawling things which He has dispersed in them. If He will, He is Able to gather all of them.","4302":"If affliction befalls you, it is what your own hands have earned, but He pardons a lot.","4303":"You are not able to frustrate Him in the earth, nor do you have a guardian and a helper other than Allah.","4304":"And among His signs are the ships that run on the sea like mountains and","4305":"if He will, He calms the wind so that they remain motionless upon its back, surely, there are signs in this for every thankful, patient (person).","4306":"Or, He wrecks them for what they have earned, but He pardons a lot.","4307":"Those who dispute Our verses may know that they have no asylum.","4308":"That which you have been given is but the enjoyment of the present life. Better and more enduring is that which Allah has for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord.","4309":"And those who avoid the major sins and indecencies and, when angered, forgive;","4310":"those who answer their Lord, establish the prayers, and their affairs are by consultation; who spend of that which We have given them,","4311":"and when harmed they become victorious.","4312":"The recompense of a sin is a sin like it, but whosoever forgives and seeks to reform, his wage will be with Allah. Surely, He does not love the harmdoers.","4313":"And whosoever harms after he has been harmed there is no blame upon them.","4314":"The blame is only against those who wrong people, and are wrongfully insolent in the earth, for them there is a painful punishment.","4315":"Surely, he who bears patiently and forgives indeed that is true constancy.","4316":"He whom Allah leads astray has none to protect him thereafter. You will see the harmdoers when they see the punishment saying: 'Is there a way back'","4317":"You shall see them exposed before it, humbled in shame and looking upon it with a furtive glance and the believers will say: 'Indeed, the losers are they who lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection' The harmdoers shall suffer an everlasting punishment.","4318":"They shall have none to protect or help them other than Allah. He whom Allah leads astray there is no way for him.","4319":"Answer your Lord before that Day arrives which cannot be turned back from Allah, for you on that Day there shall be neither shelter, nor denial.","4320":"But if they turn away, We have not sent you (Prophet Muhammad) to be their (compulsory) guardian. It is only for you to deliver (the Message). When We give the human a taste of Our Mercy, he rejoices because of it; but when, because of what he has earned, evil befalls him, the human is ungrateful.","4321":"To Allah belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He will. He gives females to whom He will and males to whom He will.","4322":"Or, He couples them, both males and females, and to others, if He will, He makes them barren. Surely, He is the Knower, the Powerful.","4323":"It does not belong to any human that Allah should speak to him except by Revelation, or from behind a veil, or that He sent a Messenger to revealwhatsoever He will by His Permission. He is the High, the Wise.","4324":"As such We have revealed to you (Prophet Muhammad) a spirit (the revelation of the Koran) from Our Ordinance. You did not know what the Book was, nor belief, but We made it a light whereby We guide those of Our worshipers whom We will. And you (Prophet Muhammad), you, surely guide to a Straight Path.","4325":"The Path of Allah, to whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. Surely, to Allah all things return.","4326":"HaMeem.","4327":"By the Clear Book","4328":"We have made it an Arabic Koran in order that you understand.","4329":"It is in the Origin of the Book with Us, sublime and wise.","4330":"Shall We turn away the Remembrance from you because you are a sinful nation?","4331":"How many a Prophet did We send to the ancients,","4332":"no Prophet came to them except that they mocked him,","4333":"so We destroyed those who were mightier in courage than they. And the example of the ancients has passed away.","4334":"Yet, if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth, they will answer: 'The Almighty, the Knower created them'","4335":"(It is) He who made the earth to be a cradle for you and made in it ways for you, in order that you are guided.","4336":"And (it is He), who sends down water from the sky in its measure thereby We revive the land that was dead, as such you shall be brought forth.","4337":"And, (it is He) who has created all the pairs and appointed for you ships and the cattle on which you ride,","4338":"so that you can sit upon their backs and then remember the Favors of your Lord and say: 'Exaltations to Him who has subjected these to us otherwise, we ourselves were not capable of it,","4339":"indeed, to our Lord we are turning'","4340":"Yet they assign to Him some of His own (created) worshipers! Clearly, the human is unthankful.","4341":"Or, has He taken daughters from those He has created for Himself and favored sons for you?","4342":"Yet when one of them is given glad news of (a daughter) that which he likened to the Merciful his face darkens and he chokes inwardly (with gloom).","4343":"(As such they attribute to Allah) who is brought up among ornaments but when disputes arise are powerless.","4344":"They claim that the angels, who are themselves the worshipers of the Merciful, are females. Did they witness their creation! Their witness shall be written down and they shall be questioned.","4345":"They say: 'Had it been the will of the Merciful, we would never have worshipped them' Of this they have no knowledge, they are but guessing.","4346":"Or have We given them a Book before this which they hold fast to?","4347":"No, but they say: 'We found our fathers following a creed, and by following in their footsteps we are guided.","4348":"As such, We never sent a warner before you to a village, except those living in luxury said: 'We found our fathers following a creed, and by following in their footsteps we are guided'","4349":"Say: 'What then if I bring you a better guidance than that you found your fathers following' But they reply: 'We disbelieve in that you have been sent with.'","4350":"So We took vengeance upon them, and see how the end was of those who lied.","4351":"(Remember) when Abraham, said to his father and his nation: 'I am quit from what you worship,","4352":"except Him who originated me, for He will guide me'","4353":"He made this an abiding word among his descendants, in order that they would return.","4354":"I gave them and their fathers days of enjoyment until the truth and a clear Messenger came to them.","4355":"But when the truth came to them, they said: 'This is sorcery, we disbelieve in it'","4356":"They also said: 'Why was this Koran not sent down to a great man from the two Villages'","4357":"What, is it they who divide the Mercy of your Lord! (It is) We who divided between them their livelihoods in this life, raising some in rank above others, sothat some may take the other into his service. Your Lord's Mercy is better than all they gather.","4358":"If it were not that mankind would be one nation We would have made for whosoever disbelieves in the Merciful silver roofs upon their houses, and stairs toclimb,","4359":"with doors to their houses and couches on which to recline;","4360":"and gold, surely, all this is but the enjoyment of this present life. The Everlasting Life with your Lord is for those who fear (Him).","4361":"To whosoever blinds himself from the Remembrance of the Merciful, We shall assign him a satan so he is his companion,","4362":"and they bar them from the Way, though they themselves think that they are guided.","4363":"And when he comes before Us, he shall say: 'Would that there had been between me and you, the distance of the two Easts' Evil is the companion.","4364":"Because of the harm you did, it would be of no benefit to you today, you are partners in the punishment.","4365":"What, will you make the deaf hear, or guide the blind and he who is in clear error?","4366":"Even if We take you away, We shall take vengeance upon them,","4367":"or We show you a part of that which We have promised them, for indeed We have power over them.","4368":"Therefore, hold fast to that which is revealed to you, indeed, you are on the Straight Path.","4369":"It is indeed a Reminder to you and to your nation, and without doubt you shall be questioned.","4370":"Ask Our Messengers whom We sent before you if We have ever made gods, other than the Merciful, to be worshipped.","4371":"We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his Council, and he said: 'I am the Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds'","4372":"But when he showed them Our signs they laughed at them,","4373":"yet there was not a sign that We showed them that was not greater than its sister, and We seized them with the punishment so that they might return.","4374":"'Sorcerer' they said, 'pray to your Lord for us in accordance to the covenant He has made with you, and surely we shall be rightly guided'","4375":"But when We had relieved them of their punishment they broke their promise.","4376":"Then Pharaoh made a proclamation to his people: 'My people, is the kingdom of Egypt not mine and these rivers which flow beneath me? What, can you not see?","4377":"Am I not better than this contemptible (man), who can scarcely make things clear (because of the impediment of his speech)?","4378":"Why have no armlets of gold been given him, or angels sent down successively with him'","4379":"He (Pharaoh) intimidated his nation, so they obeyed him, for they were a sinning nation.","4380":"And when they angered Us, We took vengeance on them and drowned all of them,","4381":"and We made them a thing of the past, and We made them an example to later people.","4382":"When the son of Mary is mentioned as an example, your people turn away from it","4383":"and say: 'What are our gods better, or is he' They do not mention him to you except to dispute, truly, they are a contentious nation.","4384":"He (Prophet Jesus) was only a worshiper whom We favored and We made him an example to the Children of Israel.","4385":"Had it been Our Will We would have made angels among you as successors in the earth.","4386":"It is the knowledge of the Hour. Have no doubt concerning it, and follow me. This is a Straight Path,","4387":"and do let satan prevent you, for he is your clear enemy.","4388":"And when (Prophet) Jesus came with clear signs, he said: 'I have come to you with wisdom and to clarify to you some of the matters about which you differ. Fear Allah and obey me.","4389":"Indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, therefore worship Him. That is the Straight Path'","4390":"Yet the parties differed among themselves. So woe to those who did evil among the punishment of a Painful Day.","4391":"Are they looking for anything except the Hour (to overtake them). It will come upon them suddenly when they are unaware!","4392":"On that Day close friends shall become enemies of each other, except those who fear (Allah).","4393":"O My worshipers, there is no fear for you on this Day, nor will you grieve","4394":"to those who believed in Our verses and were Muslims,","4395":"(it will be said) 'You and your spouses, enter, walking with joy into Paradise'","4396":"To them will be passed large platters and cups of gold.

How evil they judge!","4495":"Allah created the heavens and the earth in truth and that each soul shall be recompensed for what it earned, they shall not be wronged.","4496":"Have you seen he who took his desire for a god? With knowledge, Allah has led him astray, setting a seal upon his hearing and heart, and has made a veil over his eyes, who then shall guide him after Allah? Will you not then remember!","4497":"They say: 'There is nothing except this life, we die and we live, it is only time that destroys us' Surely, of this they have no knowledge, they are just guessing.","4498":"And when Our verses are recited to them, their only argument is: 'Bring our fathers back to us, if what you say is true'","4499":"Say: 'Allah revives you and causes you to die.

Indeed, Allah does not guide the harmdoers'","4521":"The unbelievers say of the believers: 'Had it been any good they would not have believed in it before us' And because they are not guided by it they say: 'This is an ancient falsehood'","4522":"Yet before it there was the Book of Moses which was an authority, and a mercy. This (Koran) is the Book confirming it (the other untampered Books) in theArabic tongue, to warn the harmdoers and to give glad tidings to those who do good.","4523":"Those who say: 'Our Lord is Allah' and follow the Straight Path shall have nothing to fear nor shall they sorrow.","4524":"Those, they shall be for ever the inhabitants of Paradise, a recompense for what they did.","4525":"We have charged the human to be kind to his parents.

Indeed, they went astray from them! Such were their lies and what they were forging.","4539":"(Remember) how We sent to you (Prophet Muhammad) a company of jinn who, when they came and listened to the Koran, said to each other: 'Be silent' Then, when it was finished, they returned to their nation and warned them.","4540":"'Our nation' they said: 'we have just been listening to a Book sent down after Moses confirming what came before it and guiding to the truth and to aStraight Path.","4541":"Our nation, answer the Caller of Allah and believe in Him!

If you find them to be believers do not return them to the unbelievers; they are not permitted to the unbelievers, nor are the unbelievers permitted to them. But give back to the unbelievers what they have spent, and there is no fault in you to marry such women, provided you give them their dowries.
